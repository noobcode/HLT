DDI-DrugBank.d737.s10,"Dopamine antagonists: Since pramipexole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of MIRAPEX. "
DDI-DrugBank.d737.s11,Drug/ Laboratory Test Interactions There are no known interactions between MIRAPEX and laboratory tests.
DDI-DrugBank.d636.s0,Some anticonvulsants may interact with Mephenytoin. 
DDI-DrugBank.d636.s1,They can either increase or decrease the effect of Mephenytoin. 
DDI-DrugBank.d636.s2,"Those anticonvulsants include divalproex sodium, valproic acid, and phenobarbital. "
DDI-DrugBank.d636.s3,"Mephenytoin may also affect the effects of other drugs, which include some steroid medications, warfarin, certain heart medicines, birth control pills, anti-infective medicines, furosemide and theophylline Please note that Mephenytoin may interact with other drugs that are not listed here."
DDI-DrugBank.d742.s0,"As with other drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms (e.g., pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic inhibition or enhancement, etc.) "
DDI-DrugBank.d742.s1,is a possibility. 
DDI-DrugBank.d742.s2,Drugs Affecting Hepatic Metabolism The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of REMERON SolTab    (mirtazapine) Orally Disintegrating Tablets may be affected by the induction or inhibition of drug-metab-olizing enzymes. 
DDI-DrugBank.d742.s3,"Drugs that are Metabolized by and/or Inhibit Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Many drugs are metabolized by and/or inhibit various cytochrome P450 enzymes, e.g., 2D6, 1A2, 3A4, etc. "
DDI-DrugBank.d742.s4,"In vitro studies have shown that mirtazapine is a substrate for several of these enzymes, including 2D6, 1A2, and 3A4. "
DDI-DrugBank.d742.s5,"While in vitro studies have shown that mirtazapine is not a potent inhibitor of any of these enzymes, an indication that mirtazapine is not likely to have a clinically significant inhibitory effect on the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates for these cytochrome P450 enzymes, the concomitant use of REMERON SolTab with most other drugs metabolized by these enzymes has not been formally studied. "
DDI-DrugBank.d742.s6,"Consequently, it is not possible to make any definitive statements about the risks of coadministration of REMERON SolTab    with such drugs. "
DDI-DrugBank.d742.s7,Alcohol: Concomitant administration of alcohol (equivalent to 60 g) had a minimal effect on plasma levels of mirtazapine (15 mg) in 6 healthy male subjects. 
DDI-DrugBank.d742.s8,"However, the impairment of cognitive and motor skills produced by REMERON    were shown to be additive with those produced by alcohol. "
DDI-DrugBank.d742.s9,"Accordingly, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking REMERON SolTab. Diazepam: Concomitant administration of diazepam (15 mg) had a minimal effect on plasma levels of mirtazapine (15 mg) in 12 healthy subjects. "
DDI-DrugBank.d742.s10,"However, the impairment of motor skills produced by REMERON has been shown to be additive with those caused by diazepam. "
DDI-DrugBank.d742.s11,"Accordingly, patients should be advised to avoid diazepam and other similar drugs while taking REMERON SolTab."
DDI-DrugBank.d587.s0,"Since Celontin (methsuximide) may interact with concurrently administered antiepileptic drugs, periodic serum level determinations of these drugs may be necessary (eg methsuximide may increase the plasma concentrations of phenytoin and phenobarbital)."
DDI-DrugBank.d723.s0,"Other eye drops or medications such as acetylcholine chloride (Miochol) and carbachol (Carboptic, Isopto Carbachol) may decrease the effects of suprofen ophthalmic."
DDI-DrugBank.d575.s0,"In a study in which 34 different drugs were tested, therapeutically relevant concentrations of tolbutamide, sodium salicylate and sulfamethizole displaced protein-bound teniposide in fresh human serum to a small but significant extent. "
DDI-DrugBank.d575.s1,"Because of the extremely high binding of teniposide to plasma proteins, these small decreases in binding could cause substantial increases in free drug levels in plasma which could result in potentiation of drug toxicity. "
DDI-DrugBank.d575.s2,"Therefore, caution should be used in administering VUMON (teniposide injection) to patients receiving these other agents. "
DDI-DrugBank.d575.s3,There was no change in the plasma kinetics of teniposide when coadministered with methotrexate. 
DDI-DrugBank.d575.s4,"However, the plasma clearance of methotrexate was slightly increased. "
DDI-DrugBank.d575.s5,An increase in intracellular levels of methotrexate was observed in vitro in the presence of teniposide.
DDI-DrugBank.d702.s0,SPIRIVA has been used concomitantly with other drugs commonly used in COPD without increases in adverse drug reactions. 
DDI-DrugBank.d702.s1,"These include sympathomimetic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids. "
DDI-DrugBank.d702.s2,"However, the co   administration of SPIRIVA with other anticholinergic   containing drugs (e.g., ipratropium) has not been studied and is therefore not recommended."
DDI-DrugBank.d732.s0,CHEMET is not known to interact with other drugs including iron supplements; 
DDI-DrugBank.d732.s1,interactions have not been systematically studied. 
DDI-DrugBank.d732.s2,"Concomitant administration of CHEMET with other chelation therapy, such as CaNa 2 EDTA is not recommended. "
DDI-DrugBank.d732.s3,Drug/Laboratory Tests Interaction: Succimer may interfere with serum and urinary laboratory tests. 
DDI-DrugBank.d732.s4,In vitro studies have shown succimer to cause false positive results for ketones in urine using nitroprusside reagents such as Ketostix    and falsely decreased measurements of serum uric acid and CPK.
DDI-DrugBank.d706.s0,"Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. "
DDI-DrugBank.d706.s1,"Patients treated with extended release metoprolol succinate plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension."
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s0,"Drug Interactions: Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Isozymes: Caution is advised when midazolam is administered concomitantly with drugs that are known to inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system (ie, some drugs in the drug classes of azole antimycotics, protease inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, and macrolide antibiotics). "
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s1,"Drugs such as erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole were shown to significantly increase the C max and AUC of orally administered midazolam. "
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s2,These drug interactions may result in increased and prolonged sedation due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam. 
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s3,"Although not studied, the potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors ritonavir and nelfinavir may cause intense and prolonged sedation and respiratory depression due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam. "
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s4,Caution is advised when VERSED Syrup is used concomitantly with these drugs. 
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s5,Dose adjustments should be considered and possible prolongation and intensity of effect should be anticipated. 
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s6,"Inducers of CYP3A4 Isozymes: Cytochrome P450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, induce metabolism and caused a markedly decreased C max and AUC of oral midazolam in adult studies. "
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s7,"Although clinical studies have not been performed, phenobarbital is expected to have the same effect. "
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s8,Caution is advised when administering VERSED Syrup to patients receiving these medications and if necessary dose adjustments should be considered. 
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s9,The difficulty in achieving adequate sedation may have been the result of decreased absorption of the sedatives due to both the gastrointestinal effects and stimulant effects of methylphenidate. 
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s10,"The sedative effect of VERSED Syrup is accentuated by any concomitantly administered medication which depresses the central nervous system, particularly narcotics (eg, morphine, meperidine and fentanyl), propofol, ketamine, nitrous oxide, secobarbital and droperidol. "
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s11,"Consequently, the dose of VERSED Syrup should be adjusted according to the type and amount of concomitant medications administered and the desired clinical response. "
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s12,"No significant adverse interactions with common premedications (such as atropine, scopolamine, glycopyrrolate, diazepam, hydroxyzine, and other muscle relaxants) or local anesthetics have been observed."
DDI-DrugBank.d753.s0,"The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, and alcohol may produce additive CNS depressant effects. "
DDI-DrugBank.d753.s1,"When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. "
DDI-DrugBank.d753.s2,"Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. "
DDI-DrugBank.d753.s3,It has been reported that the incidence of bradycardia was increased when oxymorphone was combined with propofol for induction of anesthesia. 
DDI-DrugBank.d753.s4,"In addition, CNS toxicity has been reported (confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures) following coadministration of cimetidine with opioid analgesics; "
DDI-DrugBank.d753.s5,no clear-cut cause and effect relationship was established.
DDI-DrugBank.d610.s0,Pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir were not altered by the addition of either lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. 
DDI-DrugBank.d610.s1,No clinically significant changes to lamivudine or zidovudine pharmacokinetics were observed following concomitant administration of abacavir. 
DDI-DrugBank.d610.s2,Abacavir has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol. 
DDI-DrugBank.d610.s3,Ethanol decreases the elimination of abacavir causing an increase in overall exposure . The addition of methadone has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir. 
DDI-DrugBank.d610.s4,"In a study of 11 HIV-infected patients receiving methadone-maintenance therapy (40 mg and 90 mg daily) with 600 mg of ZIAGEN twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased 22% (90% CI 6% to 42%). "
DDI-DrugBank.d610.s5,This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; 
DDI-DrugBank.d610.s6,"however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients."
DDI-DrugBank.d629.s0,"Oral metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of coumarin and warfarin, resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time. "
DDI-DrugBank.d629.s1,"Drug interactions should be kept in mind when METROGEL (metronidazole gel), 1% is prescribed for patients who are receiving anticoagulant treatment, although they are less likely to occur with topical metronidazole administration because of low absorption.    "
DDI-DrugBank.d722.s0,There is usually complete cross-resistance between PURINETHOL (mercaptopurine) and TABLOID brand Thioguanine. 
DDI-DrugBank.d722.s1,"As there is in vitro evidence that aminosalicylate derivatives (e.g., olsalazine, mesalazine, or sulphasalazine) inhibit the TPMT enzyme, they should be administered with caution to patients receiving concurrent thioguanine therapy.    "
DDI-DrugBank.d703.s0,"Interaction with Other Central Nervous System Depressants: MEPERIDINE SHOULD BE USED WITH GREAT CAUTION AND IN REDUCED DOSAGE IN PATIENTS WHO ARE CONCURRENTLY RECEIVING OTHER NARCOTIC ANALGESICS, GENERAL ANESTHETICS, PHENOTHIAZINES, OTHER TRANQUILIZERS, SEDATIVE-HYPNOTICS (INCLUDING BARBITURATES), TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS (INCLUDING ALCOHOL). "
DDI-DrugBank.d703.s1,"RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, HYPOTENSION, AND PROFOUND SEDATION OR COMA MAY RESULT."
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s0,"Since MEXITIL is a substrate for the metabolic pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 enzymes, inhibition or induction of either of these enzymes would be expected to alter mexiletine plasma concentrations. "
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s1,"In a formal, single-dose interaction study (n = 6 males) the clearance of mexiletine was decreased by 38% following the coadministration of fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP1A2. "
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s2,"In another formal study (n = 8 extensive and n = 7 poor metabolizers of CYP2D6), coadministration of propafenone did not alter the kinetics of mexiletine in the poor CYP2D6 metabolizer group. "
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s3,"However, the metabolic clearance of mexiletine in the extensive metabolizer phenotype decreased by about 70% making the poor and extensive metabolizer groups indistinguishable. "
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s4,"In this crossover steady state study, the pharmacokinetics of propafenone were unaffected in either phenotype by the coadministration of mexiletine. "
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s5,"Addition of mexiletine to propafenone did not lead to further electrocardiographic parameters changes of QRS, QTc, RR, and PR intervals than propafenone alone. "
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s6,"When concomitant administration of either of these two drugs with mexiletine is initiated, the dose of mexiletine should be slowly titrated to desired effect. "
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s7,"In a large compassionate use program Mexitil    has been used concurrently with commonly employed antianginal, antihypertensive, and anticoagulant drugs without observed interactions. "
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s8,"A variety of antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propranolol were also added, sometimes with improved control of ventricular ectopy. "
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s9,"When phenytoin or other hepatic enzyme inducers such as rifampin and phenobarbital have been taken concurrently with Mexitil   , lowered Mexitil    plasma levels have been reported. "
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s10,Monitoring of Mexitil    plasma levels is recommended during such concurrent use to avoid ineffective therapy. 
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s11,"In a formal study, benzodiazepines were shown not to affect Mexitil    plasma concentrations. "
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s12,"ECG intervals (PR, QRS, and QT) were not affected by concurrent Mexitil    and digoxin, diuretics, or propranolol. "
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s13,"Concurrent administration of cimetidine and Mexitil    has been reported to increase, decrease, or leave unchanged Mexitil    plasma levels; "
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s14,therefore patients should be followed carefully during concurrent therapy. 
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s15,"Mexitil    does not alter serum digoxin levels but magnesium-aluminum hydroxide, when used to treat gastrointestinal symptoms due to Mexitil   , has been reported to lower serum digoxin levels. "
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s16,Concurrent use of Mexitil    and theophylline may lead to increased plasma theophylline levels. 
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s17,One controlled study in eight normal subjects showed a 72% mean increase (range 35-136%) in plasma theophylline levels. 
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s18,"This increase was observed at the first test point which was the second day after starting Mexitil   . Theophylline plasma levels returned to pre-Mexitil    values within 48 hours after discontinuing Mexitil   . If Mexitil and theophylline are to be used concurrently, theophylline blood levels should be monitored, particularly when the Mexitil    dose is changed. "
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s19,An appropriate adjustment in theophylline dose should be considered. 
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s20,"Additionally, in one controlled study in five normal subjects and seven patients, the clearance of caffeine was decreased 50% following the administration of Mexitil   ."
DDI-DrugBank.d604.s0,"Thalidomide has been reported to enhance the sedative activity of barbiturates, alcohol, chlorpromazine, and reserpine. "
DDI-DrugBank.d604.s1,Peripheral Neuropathy: Medications known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy should be used with caution in patients receiving thalidomide. 
DDI-DrugBank.d604.s2,"Oral Contraceptives: In 10 healthy women, the pharmacokinetic profiles of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of a single dose containing 1.0 mg of norethindrone acetate and 75    g of ethinyl estradiol were studied. "
DDI-DrugBank.d604.s3,The results were similar with and without coadministration of thalidomide 200 mg/day to steady-state levels.

DDI-DrugBank.d669.s0,Concomitant administration of vancomycin and anesthetic agents has been associated with erythema and histamine-like flushing and anaphylactoid reactions. 
DDI-DrugBank.d669.s1,"Concurrent and/or sequential systemic or topical use of other potentially neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs, such as amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, bacitracin, polymyxin B, colistin, viomycin, or cisplatin, when indicated, requires careful monitoring."
DDI-DrugBank.d623.s0,No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with depo-subQ provera 104. 
DDI-DrugBank.d623.s1,Aminoglutethimide administered concomitantly with depo-subQ provera 104 may significantly decrease the serum concentrations of MPA. 
DDI-DrugBank.d623.s2,Laboratory Tests The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. 
DDI-DrugBank.d623.s3,"The physician should be informed that certain endocrine and liver function tests, and blood components may be affected by progestin therapy: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). "

DDI-DrugBank.d743.s0,"Ketoconazole: Spontaneous adverse reaction reports of patients taking concomitant ketoconazole with recommended doses of terfenadine demonstrate QT interval prolongation and rare serious cardiac events, e.g. "
DDI-DrugBank.d743.s1,"death, cardiac arrest, and ventricular arrhythmia including torsades de pointes. "
DDI-DrugBank.d743.s2,"Pharmacokinetic data indicate that ketoconazole markedly inhibits the metabolism of terfenadine, resulting in elevated plasma terfenadine levels. "
DDI-DrugBank.d743.s3,Presence of unchanged terfenadine is associated with statistically significant prolongation of the QT and QTc intervals.
DDI-DrugBank.d743.s4,Concomitant administration of ketoconazole and terfenadine is contraindicated. 
DDI-DrugBank.d743.s5,Itraconazole: Torsades de pointes and elevated parent terfenadine levels have been reported during concomitant use of terfenadine and itraconazole in clinical trials of itraconazole and from foreign post-marketing sources. 
DDI-DrugBank.d743.s6,One death has also been reported from foreign post- marketing sources. 
DDI-DrugBank.d743.s7,Concomitant administration of itraconazole and terfenadine is contraindicated. 
DDI-DrugBank.d743.s8,"Due to the chemical similarity of other azole-type antifungal agents (including fluconazole, metronidazole, and miconazole) to ketoconazole, and itraconazole, concomitant use of these products with terfenadine is not recommended pending full examination of potential interactions. "
DDI-DrugBank.d743.s9,"Macrolides: Clinical drug interaction studies indicate that erythromycin and clarithromycin can exert an effect on terfenadine metabolism by a mechanism which may be similar to that of ketoconazole, but to a lesser extent. "
DDI-DrugBank.d743.s10,"Although erythromycin measurably decreases the clearance of the terfenadine acid metabolite, its influence on terfenadine plasma levels is still under investigation. "
DDI-DrugBank.d743.s11,"A few spontaneous accounts of QT interval prolongation with ventricular arrhythmia including torsades de pointes, have been reported in patients receiving erythromycin or troleandomycin. "
DDI-DrugBank.d743.s12,"Concomitant administration of terfenadine with clarithromycin, erythromycin, or troleandomycin is contraindicated: Pending full characterization of potential interactions, concomitant administration of terfenadine with other macrolide antibiotics, including azithromycin, is not recommended.

DDI-DrugBank.d743.s13,Studies to evaluate potential interactions of terfenadine with azithromycin are in progress.
DDI-DrugBank.d746.s0,"ARAMINE should be used with caution in digitalized patients, since the combination of digitalis and sympathomimetic amines may cause ectopic arrhythmias. "
DDI-DrugBank.d746.s1,Monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants may potentiate the action of sympathomimetic amines. 
DDI-DrugBank.d746.s2,"Therefore, when initiating pressor therapy in patients receiving these drugs, the initial dose should be small and given with caution."
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s0,"Diuretics: Patients on diuretics, and especially those started recently, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of ACEON    Tablets therapy. "
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s1,The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with perindopril. 
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s2,"If diuretics cannot be interrupted, close medical supervision should be provided with the first dose of ACEON    Tablets, for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour. "
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s3,The rate and extent of perindopril absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant diuretics. 
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s4,"The bioavailability of perindoprilat was reduced by diuretics, however, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition. "
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s5,Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: ACEON    Tablets may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production. 
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s6,"Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene and others), potassium supplements or other drugs capable of increasing serum potassium (indomethacin, heparin, cyclosporine and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. "
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s7,"Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. "
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s8,Lithium: Increased serum lithium and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. 
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s9,These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium concentration is recommended. 
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s10,Use of a diuretic may further increase the risk of lithium toxicity. 
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s11,"Digoxin: A controlled pharmacokinetic study has shown no effect on plasma digoxin concentrations when coadministered with ACEON    Tablets, but an effect of digoxin on the plasma concentration of perindopril/perindoprilat has not been excluded. "
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s12,Gentamicin: Animal data have suggested the possibility of interaction between perindopril and gentamicin. 
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s13,"However, this has not been investigated in human studies. "
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s14,Coadministration of both drugs should proceed with caution. 
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s15,Food Interaction: Oral administration of ACEON    Tablets with food does not significantly lower the rate or extent of perindopril absorption relative to the fasted state. 
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s16,"However, the extent of biotransformation of perindopril to the active metabolite, perindoprilat, is reduced approximately 43%, resulting in a reduction in the plasma ACE inhibition curve of approximately 20%, probably clinically insignificant. "
DDI-DrugBank.d781.s17,"In clinical trials, perindopril was generally administered in a non-fasting state.        "
DDI-DrugBank.d654.s0,"Co-administration of oral ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily increased retapamulin geometric mean AUC(0-24) and Cmax by 81% after topical application of retapamulin ointment, 1% on the abraded skin of healthy adult males. "
DDI-DrugBank.d654.s1,"Due to low systemic exposure to retapamulin following topical application in patients, dosage adjustments for retapamulin are unnecessary when co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole. "
DDI-DrugBank.d654.s2,"Based on in vitro P450 inhibition studies and the low systemic exposure observed following topical application of ALTABAX, retapamulin is unlikely to affect the metabolism of other P450 substrates. "
DDI-DrugBank.d654.s3,The effect of concurrent application of ALTABAX and other topical products to the same area of skin has not been studied.
DDI-DrugBank.d637.s0,"Use with Other Central Nervous System Depressants: The depressant effects of morphine are potentiated by the presence of other CNS depressants such as alcohol, sedatives, antihistaminics, or psychotropic drugs. "

DDI-DrugBank.d637.s2,"Interaction with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, or buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a proof opioid agonist analgesic. "
DDI-DrugBank.d637.s3,"In these patients, the mixed agonist/antagonist may alter the analgesic effect or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms."
DDI-DrugBank.d770.s0,Nasal Spray: Formal studies designed to evaluate drug interactions with Calcitonin (salmon) have not been done. 
DDI-DrugBank.d770.s1,No drug interaction studies have been performed with Calcitonin (salmon) nasal spray ingredients. 
DDI-DrugBank.d770.s2,"Currently, no drug interactions with Calcitonin (salmon) have been observed. "

DDI-DrugBank.d676.s0,"To minimize CNS depression and possible potentiation, barbiturates, antihistamines, narcotics, hypotensive agents or phenothiazines should be used with caution. "
DDI-DrugBank.d676.s1,Ethyl alcohol should not be used since there may be an Antabuse (disulfiram)-like reaction. 
DDI-DrugBank.d676.s2,"Because Matulane exhibits some monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity, sympathomimetic drugs, tricyclic antidepressant drugs (e.g., amitriptyline HCl, imipramine HCl) and other drugs and foods with known high tyramine content, such as wine, yogurt, ripe cheese and bananas, should be avoided. "
DDI-DrugBank.d676.s3,A further phenomenon of toxicity common to many hydrazine derivatives is hemolysis and the appearance of Heinz-Ehrlich inclusion bodies in erythrocytes.  
DDI-DrugBank.d676.s4,"No cross-resistance with other chemotherapeutic agents, radiotherapy or steroids has been demonstrated."
DDI-DrugBank.d728.s0,No specific cytochrome P450-based drug interaction studies have been conducted. 
DDI-DrugBank.d728.s1,No pharmacokinetic interaction between 85 mg/m2 ELOXATIN and infusional 5-FU has been observed in patients treated every 2 weeks. 
DDI-DrugBank.d728.s2,Increases of 5-FU plasma concentrations by approximately 20% have been observed with doses of 130 mg/m2 ELOXATIN dosed every 3 weeks. 
DDI-DrugBank.d728.s3,"Since platinum containing species are eliminated primarily through the kidney, clearance of these products may be decreased by coadministration of potentially nephrotoxic compounds; "
DDI-DrugBank.d728.s4,"although, this has not been specifically studied."
DDI-DrugBank.d579.s0,Patients receiving antibiotics and sulfonamides generally should not be treated with ganglion blockers.  
DDI-DrugBank.d579.s1,"The action of Mecamylamine may be potentiated by anesthesia, other antihypertensive drugs and alcohol."
DDI-DrugBank.d665.s0,"Concurrent administration of bacteriostatic antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, tetracycline) may diminish the bactericidal effects of penicillins by slowing the rate of bacterial growth. "
DDI-DrugBank.d665.s1,Bactericidal agents work most effectively against the immature cell wall of rapidly proliferating microorganisms. 
DDI-DrugBank.d665.s2,This has been demonstrated in vitro; 
DDI-DrugBank.d665.s3,"however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented. "
DDI-DrugBank.d665.s4,There are few clinical situations in which the concurrent use of ''static'' and ''cidal '' antibiotics are indicated. 
DDI-DrugBank.d665.s5,"However, in selected circumstances in which such therapy is appropriate, using adequate doses of antibacterial agents and beginning penicillin therapy first, should minimize the potential for interaction. "
DDI-DrugBank.d665.s6,Penicillin blood levels may be prolonged by concurrent administration of probenecid which blocks the renal tubular secretion of penicillins. 
DDI-DrugBank.d665.s7,Displacement of penicillin from plasma protein binding sites will elevate the level of free penicillin in the serum.
DDI-DrugBank.d666.s0,"Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. "
DDI-DrugBank.d666.s1,"Patients receiving pindolol plus a catecholamine-depleting agent should, therefore, be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. "
DDI-DrugBank.d666.s2,"Pindolol has been used with a variety of antihypertensive agents, including hydrochlorothiazide, hydralazine, and guanethidine without unexpected adverse interactions. "
DDI-DrugBank.d666.s3,Pindolol has been shown to increase serum thioridazine levels when both drugs are co-administered. 
DDI-DrugBank.d666.s4,Pindolol levels may also be increased with this combination. 
DDI-DrugBank.d666.s5,"Risk of anaphylactic reaction: While taking beta blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. "
DDI-DrugBank.d666.s6,Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.
DDI-DrugBank.d716.s0,"You cannot take mazindol if you have taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), tranylcypromine (Parnate), or phenelzine (Nardil) in the last 14 days. "
DDI-DrugBank.d716.s1,Changes in insulin and other diabetes drug therapies may be necessary during treatment with mazindol.
DDI-DrugBank.d716.s2,Mazindol may reduce the effects of guanethidine (Ismelin). 
DDI-DrugBank.d716.s3,This could lead to an increase in blood pressure. 
DDI-DrugBank.d716.s4,Tell your doctor if you are taking guanethidine. 
DDI-DrugBank.d716.s5,"Before taking this medication, tell your doctor if you are taking a tricyclic antidepressant such as amitriptyline (Elavil), amoxapine (Asendin), doxepin (Sinequan), nortriptyline (Pamelor), imipramine (Tofranil), clomipramine (Anafranil), protriptyline (Vivactil), or desipramine (Norpramin). "
DDI-DrugBank.d716.s6,These drugs may decrease the effects of mazindol.
DDI-DrugBank.d784.s0,"The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. "
DDI-DrugBank.d784.s1,Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 
DDI-DrugBank.d784.s2,This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. 
DDI-DrugBank.d784.s3,"Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when DITROPAN XL was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. "
DDI-DrugBank.d784.s4,"Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., Cmax and AUC). "
DDI-DrugBank.d784.s5,The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. 
DDI-DrugBank.d784.s6,Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. 
DDI-DrugBank.d784.s7,"Concurrent ingestion of antacid (20 mL of antacid containing aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) did not significantly affect the exposure of oxybutynin or desethyloxybutynin.    "
DDI-DrugBank.d591.s0,"Ropivacaine should be used with caution in patients receiving other local anesthetics or agents structurally related to amide-type local anesthetics, since the toxic effects of these drugs are additive. "
DDI-DrugBank.d591.s1,"Cytochrome P4501A2 is involved in the formation of 3-hydroxy ropivacaine, the major metabolite. "
DDI-DrugBank.d591.s2,"In vivo, the plasma clearance of ropivacaine was reduced by 70% during coadministration of fluvoxamine (25 mg bid for 2 days), a selective and potent CYP1A2 inhibitor. "
DDI-DrugBank.d591.s3,"Thus strong inhibitors of cytochrome P4501A2, such as fluvoxamine, given concomitantly during administration of Ropivacaine, can interact with Ropivacaine leading to increased ropivacaine plasma levels. "
DDI-DrugBank.d591.s4,Caution should be exercised when CYP1A2 inhibitors are coadministered. 
DDI-DrugBank.d591.s5,Possible interactions with drugs known to be metabolized by CYP1A2 via competitive inhibition such as theophylline and imipramine may also occur. 
DDI-DrugBank.d591.s6,"Coadministration of a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole (100 mg bid for 2 days with ropivacaine infusion administered 1 hour after ketoconazole) caused a 15% reduction in in-vivo plasma clearance of ropivacaine."
DDI-DrugBank.d682.s0,"Sulfoxone may increase the effects of barbiturates, tolbutamide, and uricosurics. "
DDI-DrugBank.d682.s1,"It may also interact with thiazides (increased thrombocytopenia), cyclosporine (increased nephrotoxicity), sulfonylurea agents (increased hypoglycemic response), warfarin (increased anticoagulant effect), methotrexate (decreased renal excretion of methotrexate), phenytoin (decreased hepatic clearance of phenytoin)."
DDI-DrugBank.d694.s0,"Digoxin: There was a slight increase in the area under the curve (AUC, 11%) and mean peak drug concentration (Cmax, 18%) of digoxin with the co-administration of 100 mg sitagliptin for 10 days. "
DDI-DrugBank.d694.s1,Patients receiving digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 
DDI-DrugBank.d694.s2,No dosage adjustment of digoxin or JANUVIA is recommended.
DDI-DrugBank.d688.s0,Pharmacokinetic studies show that there are no significant alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters of zidovudine or rifabutin to warrant dosage adjustment when megestrol acetate is administered with these drugs. 
DDI-DrugBank.d688.s1,A pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that coadministration of megestrol acetate and indinavir results in a significant decrease in the pharmacokinetic parameters (~36% for Cmax and ~28% for AUC) of indinavir. 
DDI-DrugBank.d688.s2,Administration of a higher dose of indinavir should be considered when coadministering with megestrol acetate. 
DDI-DrugBank.d688.s3,"The effects of indinavir, zidovudine or rifabutin on the pharmacokinetics of megestrol acetate were not studied."
DDI-DrugBank.d769.s0,Coumarin-Derivative Anticoagulants: Prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were observed in patients receiving ZOLINZA concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants. 
DDI-DrugBank.d769.s1,Physicians should carefully monitor PT and INR in patients concurrently administered ZOLINZA and coumarin derivatives. 
DDI-DrugBank.d769.s2,"Other HDAC Inhibitors Severe thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported with concomitant use of ZOLINZA and other HDAC inhibitors (e.g., valproic acid). "

DDI-DrugBank.d678.s0,"Drugs affecting pituitary or adrenocortical function, including all corticosteroid therapy, must be discontinued prior to and during testing with Metopirone. "
DDI-DrugBank.d678.s1,The metabolism of Metopirone is accelerated by phenytoin; 
DDI-DrugBank.d678.s2,"therefore, results of the test may be inaccurate in patients taking phenytoin within two weeks before. "
DDI-DrugBank.d678.s3,Asubnormal response may occur in patients on estrogen therapy. 
DDI-DrugBank.d678.s4,Metopirone inhibits the glucuronidation of acetaminophen and could possibly potentiate acetaminophen toxicity.
DDI-DrugBank.d738.s0,Do not exceed a 5 mg daily dose of VESIcare when administered with therapeutic doses of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
DDI-DrugBank.d738.s1,"Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin on the QT interval in 76 healthy women, the QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin 10 mg than with 30 mg (three times the maximum recommended dose), and the effect of solifenacin 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. "
DDI-DrugBank.d738.s2,This observation should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe VESIcare for patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval.
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s0,"In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, and cyclosporine. "
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s1,In vitro studies have also shown that terbinafine inhibits CYP2D6-mediated metabolism. 
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s2,"This may be of clinical relevance for compounds predominantly metabolized by this enzyme, such as tricyclic antidepressants,    -blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-Is) Type B, if they have a narrow therapeutic window. "
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s3,In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in normal volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. 
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s4,Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. 
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s5,Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. 
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s6,"There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between LAMISIL    Tablets and these changes has not been established. "
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s7,"Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CyP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CyP450 enzyme inhibitor. "
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s8,Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. 
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s9,"There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, theophyllines, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers."
DDI-DrugBank.d686.s0,"Thiabendazole may compete with other drugs, such as theophylline, for sites of metabolism in the liver, thus elevating the serum levels of such compounds to potentially toxic levels. "
DDI-DrugBank.d686.s1,"Therefore, when concomitant use of thiabendazole and xanthine derivatives is anticipated, it may be necessary to monitor blood levels and/or reduce the dosage of such compounds. "
DDI-DrugBank.d686.s2,Such concomitant use should be administered under careful medical supervision.
DDI-DrugBank.d607.s0,Interactions between Leukine and other drugs have not been fully evaluated. 
DDI-DrugBank.d607.s1,"Drugs which may potentiate the myeloproliferative effects of Leukine, such as lithium and corticosteroids, should be used with caution."
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s0,Diuretics: Furosemide and probably other loop diuretics given concomitantly with metolazone can cause unusually large or prolonged losses of fluid and electrolytes. 
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s1,"Other Antihypertensives: When MYKROX Tablets are used with other antihypertensive drugs, care must be taken, especially during initial therapy. "
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s2,Dosage adjustments of other antihypertensives may be necessary. 
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s3,"Alcohol, Barbiturates, and Narcotics: The hypotensive effects of these drugs may be potentiated by the volume contraction that may be associated with metolazone therapy. "
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s4,Digitalis Glycosides: Diuretic-induced hypokalemia can increase the sensitivity of the myocardium to digitalis. 
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s5,Serious arrhythmias can result. 
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s6,Corticosteroids or ACTH: May increase the risk of hypokalemia and increase salt and water retention. 
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s7,Lithium: Serum lithium levels may increase. 
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s8,Curariform Drugs: Diuretic-induced hypokalemia may enhance neuromuscular blocking effects of curariform drugs (such as tubocurarine) the most serious effect would be respiratory depression which could proceed to apnea. 
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s9,"Accordingly, it may be advisable to discontinue MYKROX Tablets three days before elective surgery. "
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s10,Salicylates and Other Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: May decrease the antihypertensive effects of MYKROX Tablets. 
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s11,"Sympathomimetics: Metolazone may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine, but this diminution is not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. "
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s12,Methenamine: Efficacy may be decreased due to urinary alkalizing effect of metolazone. 
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s13,"Anticoagulants: Metolazone, as well as other thiazide-like diuretics, may affect the hypoprothrombinemic response to anticoagulants; "
DDI-DrugBank.d588.s14,dosage adjustments may be necessary.
DDI-DrugBank.d670.s0,Potential for INVEGA    to Affect Other Drugs Paliperidone is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes. 
DDI-DrugBank.d670.s1,"In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that paliperidone does not substantially inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9/10, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5. "
DDI-DrugBank.d670.s2,"Therefore, paliperidone is not expected to inhibit clearance of drugs that are metabolized by these metabolic pathways in a clinically relevant manner. "
DDI-DrugBank.d670.s3,Paliperidone is also not expected to have enzyme inducing properties. 
DDI-DrugBank.d670.s4,"At therapeutic concentrations, paliperidone did not inhibit P-glycoprotein. "
DDI-DrugBank.d670.s5,Paliperidone is therefore not expected to inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport of other drugs in a clinically relevant manner. 
DDI-DrugBank.d670.s6,"Given the primary CNS effects of paliperidone, INVEGA    should be used with caution in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. "
DDI-DrugBank.d670.s7,Paliperidone may antagonize the effect of levodopa and other dopamine agonists. 
DDI-DrugBank.d670.s8,"Because of its potential for inducing orthostatic hypotension, an additive effect may be observed when INVEGA    is administered with other therapeutic agents that have this potential. "
DDI-DrugBank.d670.s9,"Potential for Other Drugs to Affect INVEGA    Paliperidone is not a substrate of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, so that an interaction with inhibitors or inducers of these isozymes is unlikely. "
DDI-DrugBank.d670.s10,"While in vitro studies indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may be minimally involved in paliperidone metabolism, in vivo studies do not show decreased elimination by these isozymes and they contribute to only a small fraction of total body clearance."
DDI-DrugBank.d640.s0,Diuretics: Excessive reductions in blood pressure may occur in patients on diuretic therapy when ACE inhibitors are started. 
DDI-DrugBank.d640.s1,"The possibility of hypotensive effects with UNIVASC    can be minimized by discontinuing diuretic therapy for several days or cautiously increasing salt intake before initiation of treatment with UNIVASC   . If this is not possible, the starting dose of moexpril should be reduced.. "
DDI-DrugBank.d640.s2,Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: UNIVASC    can increase serum potassium because it decreases aldosterone secretion. 
DDI-DrugBank.d640.s3,"Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride) or potassium supplements concomitantly with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. "
DDI-DrugBank.d640.s4,"Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored. "
DDI-DrugBank.d640.s5,Oral Anticoagulants: Interaction studies with warfarin failed to identify any clinically important effect on the serum concentrations of the anticoagulant or on its anticoagulant effect. 
DDI-DrugBank.d640.s6,Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. 
DDI-DrugBank.d640.s7,"These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. "
DDI-DrugBank.d640.s8,"If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. "
DDI-DrugBank.d640.s9,"Other Agents: No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when UNIVASC    was administered concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, or cimetidine. "
DDI-DrugBank.d640.s10,"UNIVASC    has been used in clinical trials concomitantly with calcium-channel-blocking agents, diuretics, H2 blockers, digoxin, oral hypoglycemic agents, and cholesterol-lowering agents. "
DDI-DrugBank.d640.s11,There was no evidence of clinically important adverse interactions.
DDI-DrugBank.d736.s0,"Hypokalemia can sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). "
DDI-DrugBank.d736.s1,Hypokalemia may develop during concomitant use of steroids or ACTH. 
DDI-DrugBank.d736.s2,"Insulin requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. "
DDI-DrugBank.d736.s3,Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine. 
DDI-DrugBank.d736.s4,This diminution is not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. 
DDI-DrugBank.d736.s5,Thiazide drugs may increase the responsiveness of tubocurarine. 
DDI-DrugBank.d736.s6,"Lithium renal clearance is reduced by thiazides, increasing the risk of lithium toxicity. "
DDI-DrugBank.d736.s7,Thiazides may add to or potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs. 
DDI-DrugBank.d736.s8,Potentiation occurs with ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic blocking drugs.
DDI-DrugBank.d757.s0,"Usage with Alcohol: Due to the potential for increased CNS depressants effects, alcohol should be used with caution in patients who are currently receiving pentazocine."
DDI-DrugBank.d766.s0,"Since trimetrexate is metabolized by a P450 enzyme system, drugs that induce or inhibit this drug metabolizing enzyme system may elicit important drug-drug interactions that may alter trimetrexate plasma concentrations. "
DDI-DrugBank.d766.s1,"Agents that might be coadministered with trimetrexate in AIDS patients for other indications that could elicit this activity include erythromycin, rifampin, rifabutin, ketoconazole, and fluconazole. "
DDI-DrugBank.d766.s2,In vitro perfusion of isolated rat liver has shown that cimetidine caused a significant reduction in trimetrexate metabolism and that acetaminophen altered the relative concentration of trimetrexate metabolites possibly by competing for sulfate metabolites. 
DDI-DrugBank.d766.s3,"Based on an in vitro rat liver model, nitrogen substituted imidazole drugs (clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole) were potent, non-competitive inhibitors of trimetrexate metabolism. "
DDI-DrugBank.d766.s4,Patients medicated with these drugs and trimetrexate should be carefully monitored.
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s0,The pharmacokinetic interactions listed below are potentially clinically important. 
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s1,Mutual inhibition of metabolism occurs with concurrent use of cyclosporin and methylprednisolone; 
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s2,"therefore, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur. "
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s3,convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin. 
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s4,"Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampin may increase the clearance of methylprednisolone and may require increased in methylprednisolone dose to achieve the desired response. "
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s5,Drugs such as troleandomycin and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of methylprednisolone and thus decrease its clearance. 
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s6,"Therefore, the dose of methylprednisolone should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. "
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s7,Methylprednisolone may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspirin. 
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s8,This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when methylprednisolone is withdrawn. 
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s9,Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia. 
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s10,The effect of methylprednisolone on oral anticoagulants is variable. 
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s11,There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulant when given concurrently with corticosteroids. 
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s12,"Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect."
DDI-DrugBank.d699.s0,"Mequitazine can interact with CNS depressant, antichlolinergic, TCA, MAOIs, and alcohol."
DDI-DrugBank.d741.s0,"In a pharmacokinetic study of 18 chronic hepatitis C patients concomitantly receiving methadone, treatment with PEG-Intron once weekly for 4 weeks was associated with a mean increase of 16% in methadone AUC; "
DDI-DrugBank.d741.s1,"in 2 out of 18 patients, methadone AUC doubled. "
DDI-DrugBank.d741.s2,The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; 
DDI-DrugBank.d741.s3,"however, patients should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of increased narcotic effect."
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s0,Cholestyramine: Concomitant cholestyramine administration decreased the mean AUC of total ezetimibe approximately 55%. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s1,The incremental LDL-C reduction due to adding ezetimibe to cholestyramine may be reduced by this interaction. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s2,Fibrates: The safety and effectiveness of ezetimibe administered with fibrates have not been established. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s3,"Fibrates may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis. "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s4,"In a preclinical study in dogs, ezetimibe increased cholesterol in the gallbladder bile. "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s5,Co-administration of ZETIA with fibrates is not recommended until use in patients is studied. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s6,"Fenofibrate: In a pharmacokinetic study, concomitant fenofibrate administration increased total ezetimibe concentrations approximately 1.5-fold. "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s7,"Gemfibrozil: In a pharmacokinetic study, concomitant gemfibrozil administration increased total ezetimibe concentrations approximately 1.7-fold. "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s8,"HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were seen when ezetimibe was co-administered with atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, or fluvastatin. "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s9,"Cyclosporine: The total ezetimibe level increased 12-fold in one renal transplant patient receiving multiple medications, including cyclosporine. "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s10,Patients who take both ezetimibe and cyclosporine should be carefully monitored. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s11,"Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study with ezetimibe was conducted in rats at doses up to 1500 mg/kg/day (males) and 500 mg/kg/day (females) (~20 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe). "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s12,A 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study with ezetimibe was also conducted in mice at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (>150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe). 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s13,There were no statistically significant increases in tumor incidences in drug-treated rats or mice. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s14,No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro in a microbial mutagenicity (Ames) test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli with or without metabolic activation. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s15,No evidence of clastogenicity was observed in vitro in a chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s16,"In addition, there was no evidence of genotoxicity in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s17,"In oral (gavage) fertility studies of ezetimibe conducted in rats, there was no evidence of reproductive toxicity at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day in male or female rats (~7 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe). "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s18,Pregnancy Pregnancy Category: C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ezetimibe in pregnant women. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s19,Ezetimibe should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s20,"In oral (gavage) embryo-fetal development studies of ezetimibe conducted in rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there was no evidence of embryolethal effects at the doses tested (250, 500, 1000 mg/kg/day). "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s21,"In rats, increased incidences of common fetal skeletal findings (extra pair of thoracic ribs, unossified cervical vertebral centra, shortened ribs) were observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (~10 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe). "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s22,"In rabbits treated with ezetimibe, an increased incidence of extra thoracic ribs was observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe). "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s23,Ezetimibe crossed the placenta when pregnant rats and rabbits were given multiple oral doses. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s24,Multiple dose studies of ezetimibe given in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in rats and rabbits during organogenesis result in higher ezetimibe and statin exposures. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s25,Reproductive findings occur at lower doses in combination therapy compared to monotherapy. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s26,All HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnant and nursing women. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s27,"When ZETIA is administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in a woman of childbearing potential, refer to the pregnancy category and package labeling for the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s28,Labor and Delivery The effects of ZETIA on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s29,"Nursing Mothers In rat studies, exposure to total ezetimibe in nursing pups was up to half of that observed in maternal plasma. "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s30,It is not known whether ezetimibe is excreted into human breast milk; 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s31,"therefore, ZETIA should not be used in nursing mothers unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant. "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s32,Pediatric Use The pharmacokinetics of ZETIA in adolescents (10 to 18 years) have been shown to be similar to that in adults. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s33,Treatment experience with ZETIA in the pediatric population is limited to 4 patients (9 to 17 years) in the sitosterolemia study and 5 patients (11 to 17 years) in the HoFH study. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s34,Treatment with ZETIA in children (<10 years) is not recommended. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s35,"Geriatric Use Of the patients who received ZETIA in clinical studies, 948 were 65 and older (this included 206 who were 75 and older). "
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s36,The effectiveness and safety of ZETIA were similar between these patients and younger subjects. 
DDI-DrugBank.d572.s37,Greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s0,ACE inhibitors Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s1,This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s2,Aspirin: Concomitant administration of aspirin (1000 mg TID) to healthy volunteers tended to increase the AUC (10%) and Cmax (24%) of meloxicam. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s3,The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s4,"however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of meloxicam and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects. "
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s5,"Concomitant administration of low-dose aspirin with MOBIC may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of MOBIC alone. "
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s6,MOBIC is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s7,Cholestyramine: Pretreatment for four days with cholestyramine significantly increased the clearance of meloxicam by 50%. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s8,"This resulted in a decrease in t1/2, from 19.2 hours to 12.5 hours, and a 35% reduction in AUC. "
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s9,This suggests the existence of a recirculation pathway for meloxicam in the gastrointestinal tract. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s10,The clinical relevance of this interaction has not been established. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s11,Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of 200 mg cimetidine QID did not alter the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 30 mg meloxicam. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s12,Digoxin: Meloxicam 15 mg once daily for 7 days did not alter the plasma concentration profile of digoxin after b-acetyldigoxin administration for 7 days at clinical doses. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s13,In vitro testing found no protein binding drug interaction between digoxin and meloxicam. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s14,"Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics in some patients. "
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s15,This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s16,Studies with furosemide agents and meloxicam have not demonstrated a reduction in natriuretic effect. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s17,Furosemide: single and multiple dose pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are not affected by multiple doses of meloxicam. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s18,"Nevertheless, during concomitant therapy with furosemide and MOBIC, patients should be observed closely for signs of declining renal function, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. "
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s19,"Lithium: In clinical trials, NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. "
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s20,"In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean pre-dose lithium concentration and AUC were increased by 21% in subjects receiving lithium doses ranging from 804 to 1072 mg BID with meloxicam 15 mg QD as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone. "
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s21,These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by MOBIC. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s22,Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when MOBIC is introduced or withdrawn. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s23,Methotrexate: A study in 13 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients evaluated the effects of multiple doses of meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate taken once weekly. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s24,Meloxicam did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of methotrexate. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s25,"In vitro, methotrexate did not displace meloxicam from its human serum binding sites. "
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s26,"Warfarin: Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing MOBIC therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding. "
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s27,The effect of meloxicam on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily doses of warfarin that produced an INR (International Normalized Ratio) between 1.2 and 1.8. 
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s28,"In these subjects, meloxicam did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics and the average anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time. "
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s29,"However, one subject showed an increase in INR from 1.5 to 2.1. "
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s30,Caution should be used when administering MOBIC with warfarin since patients on warfarin may experience changes in INR and an increased risk of bleeding complications when a new medication is introduced.
DDI-DrugBank.d698.s0,Interactions for Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin):  Alcohol - impairs the intestinal absorption of riboflavin
DDI-DrugBank.d698.s1,Probenecid - concurrent use decreases gastrointestinal absorption of riboflavin; 
DDI-DrugBank.d698.s2,requirements for riboflavin may be increased in patients receiving probenecid.
DDI-DrugBank.d726.s0,"Paricalcitol is not expected to inhibit the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. "
DDI-DrugBank.d726.s1,"A multiple dose drug-drug interaction study demonstrated that ketoconazole approximately doubled paricalcitol AUC0-   . Since paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A and ketoconazole le is known to be a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A enzyme, care should be taken while dosing paricalcitol with ketoconazole and other strong P450 3A inhibitors including atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin or voriconazole. "
DDI-DrugBank.d726.s2,"Dose adjustment of Zemplar Capsules may be required, and iPTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor such as ketoconazole. "
DDI-DrugBank.d726.s3,"Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine, may interfere with the absorption of Zemplar Capsules."
DDI-DrugBank.d751.s0,AGGRASTAT has been studied on a background of aspirin and heparin. 
DDI-DrugBank.d751.s1,"The use of AGGRASTAT, in combination with heparin and aspirin, has been associated with an increase in bleeding compared to heparin and aspirin alone (see"
DDI-DrugBank.d615.s0,"Triprolidine may enhance the sedative effects of central nervous system depressants including alcohol, barbiturates, hypnotics, narcotic analgesics, sedatives, and tranquillisers. "
DDI-DrugBank.d615.s1,"The effects of anticholinergic drugs, such as atropine and tricyclic antidepressants may be enhanced by the concomitant administration of triprolidine. "
DDI-DrugBank.d615.s2,Triprolidine may effect the metabolism of drugs in the liver.
DDI-DrugBank.d650.s0,"Dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthines ) or metoclopramide, ordinarily should not be administered concurrently with Permax (a dopamine agonist); "
DDI-DrugBank.d650.s1,these agents may diminish the effectiveness of Permax. 
DDI-DrugBank.d650.s2,"Because pergolide mesylate is approximately 90% bound to plasma proteins, caution should be exercised if pergolide mesylate is coadministered with other drugs known to affect protein binding."
DDI-DrugBank.d763.s0,Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. 
DDI-DrugBank.d763.s1,"Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. "
DDI-DrugBank.d763.s2,"On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs.  "
DDI-DrugBank.d763.s3,"Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin: In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. "
DDI-DrugBank.d763.s4,"However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3  Tramadol: Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5  Chemotherapy: Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P 388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. "
DDI-DrugBank.d763.s5,"In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron.  "
DDI-DrugBank.d763.s6,"In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. "
DDI-DrugBank.d763.s7,ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate.
DDI-DrugBank.d720.s0,Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. 
DDI-DrugBank.d720.s1,"Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided. "
DDI-DrugBank.d720.s2,"MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. "
DDI-DrugBank.d720.s3,"Therefore, the use of sumatriptan succinate tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) have been reported, rarely, to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with sumatriptan. "
DDI-DrugBank.d720.s4,"If concomitant treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised."
DDI-DrugBank.d631.s0,"Pyrimethamine may be used with sulfonamides, quinine and other antimalarials, and with other antibiotics. "
DDI-DrugBank.d631.s1,"If signs of folate deficiency develop, pyrimethamine should be discontinued. "
DDI-DrugBank.d631.s2,Folinic acid (leucovorin) should be administered until normal hematopoiesis is restored. 
DDI-DrugBank.d631.s3,Mild hepatotoxicity has been reported in some patients when lorazepam and pyrimethamine were administered concomitantly.
DDI-DrugBank.d750.s0,Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine hydrochloride may result in an adverse drug interaction.
DDI-DrugBank.d744.s0,Acromegalic patients with diabetes mellitus being treated with insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agents may require dose reductions of these therapeutic agents after the initiation of therapy with SOMAVERT. 
DDI-DrugBank.d744.s1,"In clinical studies, patients on opioids often needed higher serum pegvisomant concentrations to achieve appropriate IGF-I suppression compared with patients not receiving opioids. "
DDI-DrugBank.d744.s2,The mechanism of this interaction is not known.
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s0,Anticholinesterases: Concurrent use of procaine hydrochloride and anticholinesterase agents may result in increased systemic toxicity since anticholinesterases inhibit the breakdown of procaine hydrochloride. 
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s1,Antimyasthenics Concurrent use of procaine hydrochloride and antimyasthenics may result in loss of control of symptoms of myasthenia gravis due to antagonism of the effects of antimyasthenics on skeletal muscle. 
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s2,Temporary dosage adjustment of antimyasthenics may be required. 
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s3,Also antimyasthenics may have anticholinesterase activity. 
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s4,CNS depressant medications: Concurrent use of procaine hydrochloride and CNS depressant medications may result in additive depressant effects. 
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s5,"Hyaluronidase: Hyaluronidase may increase the diffusion rate of procaine hydrochloride, resulting in a decreased time of onset, but an increase in systemic toxicity. "
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s6,Neuromuscular blocking agents (such as suxamethonium chloride): Concurrent use of procaine hydrochloride and neuromuscular blocking agents may result in prolongation or enhancement of the neuromuscular blockade. 
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s7,Sulfonamides: Concurrent use of procaine hydrochloride and sulfonamides may result in a reduction of the antibacterial action of the sulfonamide. 
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s8,Acetazolamide: Concurrent use of acetazolamide and procaine hydrochloride may extend the plasma half-life of procaine.
DDI-DrugBank.d622.s0,"When atropine and pralidoxime are used together, the signs of atropinization (flushing, mydriasis, tachycardia, dryness of the mouth and nose) may occur earlier than might be expected when atropine is used alone. "
DDI-DrugBank.d622.s1,This is especially true if the total dose of atropine has been large and the administration of pralidoxime has been delayed. 
DDI-DrugBank.d622.s2,"2 - 4 The following precautions should be kept in mind in the treatment of anticholinesterase poisoning, although they do not bear directly on the use of pralidoxime: since barbiturates are potentiated by the anticholinesterases, they should be used cautiously in the treatment of convulsions; "
DDI-DrugBank.d622.s3,"morphine, theophylline, aminophylline, succinylcholine, reserpine, and phenothiazine-type tranquilizers should be avoided in patients with organophosphate poisoning."
DDI-DrugBank.d627.s0,Pilocarpine should be administered with caution to patients taking beta adrenergic antagonists because of the possibility of conduction disturbances. 
DDI-DrugBank.d627.s1,Drugs with parasympathomimetic effects administered concurrently with pilocarpine would be expected to result in additive pharmacologic effects. 
DDI-DrugBank.d627.s2,Pilocarpine might antagonize the anticholinergic effects of drugs used concomitantly. 
DDI-DrugBank.d627.s3,"These effects should be considered when anticholinergic properties may be contributing to the therapeutic effect of concomitant medication (e.g., atropine, inhaled ipratropium). "
DDI-DrugBank.d627.s4,"While no formal drug interaction studies have been performed, the following concomitant drugs were used in at least 10% of patients in either or both Sj   grens efficacy studies: acetylsalicylic acid, artificial tears, calcium, conjugated estrogens, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, ibuprofen, levothyroxine sodium, medroxyprogesterone acetate, methotrexate, multivitamins, naproxen, omeprazole, paracetamol, and prednisone."
DDI-DrugBank.d641.s0,ALIMTA is primarily eliminated unchanged renally as a result of glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. 
DDI-DrugBank.d641.s1,Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drugs could result in delayed clearance of ALIMTA. 
DDI-DrugBank.d641.s2,"Concomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g., probenecid) could potentially result in delayed clearance of ALIMTA. "
DDI-DrugBank.d641.s3,"Although ibuprofen (400 mg qid) can be administered with ALIMTA in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance    80 mL/min), caution should be used when administering ibuprofen concurrently with ALIMTA to patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 mL/min). "
DDI-DrugBank.d641.s4,"Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency should avoid taking NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives for a period of 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of ALIMTA. "
DDI-DrugBank.d641.s5,"In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between ALIMTA and NSAIDs with longer half-lives, all patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least 5 days before, the day of, and 2 days following ALIMTA administration. "
DDI-DrugBank.d641.s6,"If concomitant administration of an NSAID is necessary, patients should be monitored closely for toxicity, especially myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity. "
DDI-DrugBank.d641.s7,Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions None known.
DDI-DrugBank.d609.s0,An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (such as gemfibrozil) may increase the AUC of rosiglitazone and an inducer of CYP2C8 (such as rifampin) may decrease the AUC of rosiglitazone. 
DDI-DrugBank.d609.s1,"Therefore, if an inhibitor or an inducer of CYP2C8 is started or stopped during treatment with rosiglitazone, changes in diabetes treatment may be needed based upon clinical response."
DDI-DrugBank.d762.s0,Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion and thus inhibits the renal excretion of meropenem. 
DDI-DrugBank.d762.s1,This led to statistically significant increases in the elimination half-life (38%) and in the extent of systemic exposure (56%). 
DDI-DrugBank.d762.s2,"Therefore, the coadministration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. "
DDI-DrugBank.d762.s3,There is evidence that meropenem may reduce serum levels of valproic acid to subtherapeutic levels (therapeutic range considered to be 50 to 100    g/mL total valproate).
DDI-DrugBank.d709.s0,Concomitant administration contra-indicated:  - Vasoconstrictive ergot alkaloids.  
DDI-DrugBank.d709.s1,Concomitant administrations not recommended:  - Terfenadine and astemizole: Certain macrolides interact with terfenadine and astemizole leading to increased serum concentrations of the latter. 
DDI-DrugBank.d709.s2,"This may result in severe ventricular arrhythmia, typically torsades de pointe. "
DDI-DrugBank.d709.s3,"Although such a reaction has not been demonstrated with roxithromycin, concomitant administration of roxithromycin with terfenadine or astemizole is not recommended. "
DDI-DrugBank.d709.s4,"- Cisapride, pimozide: Other drugs such as cisapride or pimozide, which are metabolised by hepatic CYP3A isozymes have been associated with QT interval prolongation and/or cardiac arrythmias (typically torsades de pointe) as a result of increase in their serum level subsequent to interaction with significant inhibitors of the isozyme, including some macrolide antibacterials. "
DDI-DrugBank.d709.s5,"Although such a risk is not verified for roxithromycin, combination of roxithromycin with such drugs is not recommended."
DDI-DrugBank.d712.s0,There have been no formal drug interaction studies performed with HERCEPTIN in humans. 
DDI-DrugBank.d712.s1,Administration of paclitaxel in combination with HERCEPTIN resulted in a two-fold decrease in HERCEPTIN clearance in a non-human primate study and in a 1.5-fold increase in HERCEPTIN serum levels in clinical studies.
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s0,"Antacids: Absorption of a single dose of Myfortic was decreased when administered to 12 stable renal transplant patients also taking magnesium-aluminum containing antacids (30 mL): the mean Cmax and AUC(0-t) values for MPA were 25% and 37% lower, respectively, than when Myfortic was administered alone under fasting conditions. "
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s1,It is recommended that Myfortic and antacids not be administered simultaneously. 
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s2,"Cyclosporine: When studied in stable renal transplant patients, cyclosporine, USP (MODIFIED) pharmacokinetics were unaffected by steady state dosing of Myfortic. "
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s3,Acyclovir/Ganciclovir: may be taken with Myfortic; 
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s4,"however, during the period of treatment, physicians should monitor blood cell counts. "
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s5,"Both acyclovir/ganciclovir and MPAG concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, their coexistence may compete for tubular secretion and further increase in the concentrations of the two. "
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s6,"Azathioprine/Mycophenolate Mofetil: Given that azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil inhibit purine metabolism, it is recommended that Myfortic not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. "
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s7,Cholestyramine and Drugs that Bind Bile Acids: These drugs interrupt enterohepatic recirculation and reduce MPA exposure when coadministered with mycophenolate mofetil. 
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s8,"Therefore, do not administer Myfortic with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation or drugs that may bind bile acids, for example bile acid sequestrates or oral activated charcoal, because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of Myfortic. "
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s9,"Oral Contraceptives: Given the different metabolism of Myfortic and oral contraceptives, no drug interaction between these two classes of drug is expected. "
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s10,"However, in a drug-drug interaction study, mean levonorgesterol AUC was decreased by 15% when coadministered with mycophenolate mofetil. "
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s11,"Therefore, it is recommended that oral contraceptives are co- administered with Myfortic with caution and additional birth control methods be considered. "
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s12,"Live Vaccines: During treatment with Myfortic, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective. "
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s13,Influenza vaccination may be of value. 
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s14,Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination. 
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s15,Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with Myfortic by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. 
DDI-DrugBank.d700.s16,Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption.
DDI-DrugBank.d643.s0,"Melatonin may interact with the following drugs: aspirin and other NSAIDs (may lower melatonin levels), fluvoxamine (bioavailability of oral melatonin is increased with coadministration), beta blockers (may decrease melatonin levels), fluoxetine (reports of psychotic episodes when coadministered), progestin (coadministration of melatonin with progestin can inhibit ovarian function in women), benzodiazepenes and other sedating drugs (may result in additive sedation and an increased incidence of adverse effects), and corticosteroids (coadministration of melatonin and corticosteroids may interfere with the efficacy of the corticosteroids)."
DDI-DrugBank.d711.s0,"Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. "
DDI-DrugBank.d711.s1,"Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. "
DDI-DrugBank.d711.s2,"Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. "
DDI-DrugBank.d711.s3,The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 
DDI-DrugBank.d711.s4,Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective.
DDI-DrugBank.d761.s0,"Alcohol: In a multiple-dose study in 30 normal weight subjects, coadministration of XENICAL and 40 grams of alcohol (e.g., approximately 3 glasses of wine) did not result in alteration of alcohol pharmacokinetics, orlistat pharmacodynamics (fecal fat excretion), or systemic exposure to orlistat. "
DDI-DrugBank.d761.s1,Cyclosporine: Preliminary data from a XENICAL and cyclosporine drug interaction study indicate a reduction in cyclosporine plasma levels when XENICAL was coadministered with cyclosporine.

DDI-DrugBank.d584.s4,Microscopic hematuria (9/15) and gingival bleeding (1/15) were also observed. 
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s5,"A 5.5-fold decrease in the mean warfarin dose from 6.13 mg/day to 1.13 mg/day (approximately 80-85% reduction of warfarin dose), was necessary to maintain a target INR of 1.5. "
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s6,"When oxandrolone therapy is initiated in a patient already receiving treatment with warfarin, the INR or prothrombin time (PT) should be monitored closely and the dose of warfarin adjusted as necessary until a stable target INR or PT has been achieved. "
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s7,"Furthermore, in patients receiving both drugs, careful monitoring of the INR or PT, and adjustment of the warfarin dosage if indicated are recommended when the oxandrolone dose is changed or discontinued. "
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s8,Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of occult bleeding.

DDI-DrugBank.d653.s1,"Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and rifampin may increase the clearance of corticosteroids and may require increases in corticosteroid dose to achieve the desired response. "
DDI-DrugBank.d653.s2,Drugs such as troleandomycin and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids and thus decrease their clearance. 
DDI-DrugBank.d653.s3,"Therefore, the dose of corticosteroid should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. "
DDI-DrugBank.d653.s4,Corticosteroids may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspirin. 
DDI-DrugBank.d653.s5,This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when corticosteroid is withdrawn. 
DDI-DrugBank.d653.s6,Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia. 
DDI-DrugBank.d653.s7,The effect of corticosteroids on oral anticoagulants is variable.

DDI-DrugBank.d776.s20,"Terfenadine: Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine, interaction studies have been performed. "
DDI-DrugBank.d776.s21,One study at a 200-mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval. 
DDI-DrugBank.d776.s22,Another study at a 400-mg and 800-mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly. 
DDI-DrugBank.d776.s23,The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated. 
DDI-DrugBank.d776.s24,The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg/day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored.

DDI-DrugBank.d776.s35,"Short-acting Benzodiazepines: Following oral administration of midazolam, fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects. "
DDI-DrugBank.d776.s36,This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously. 
DDI-DrugBank.d776.s37,"If short-acting benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole, consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored. "
DDI-DrugBank.d776.s38,Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol- and levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels; 
DDI-DrugBank.d776.s39,"however, in some patients there were decreases up to 47% and 33% of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels. "
DDI-DrugBank.d776.s40,The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation. 
DDI-DrugBank.d776.s41,"While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism. "

"
DDI-MedLine.d227.s1,"Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonist, was recently introduced into clinical practice for its sedative and analgesic properties. "
DDI-MedLine.d227.s2,The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the psychostimulant drug ephedrine has any effect on dexmedetomidine-induced antinociception and locomotor inhibitor activity in mice in acute application.
DDI-MedLine.d227.s3,In both sexes of swiss albino mice; 
DDI-MedLine.d227.s4,"antinociception was assessed with hot-plate test and the locomotor, exploratory activities were assessed with holed open field test. "
DDI-MedLine.d227.s5,The animals were received; 
DDI-MedLine.d227.s6,"saline + saline, ephedrine (10   mg/kg) + saline, saline + dexmedetomidine (15     g/kg) and ephedrine (10   mg/kg) + dexmedetomidine (15     g/kg), intraperitoneally, 30 min before hot plate or holed open field tests. "
DDI-MedLine.d227.s7,"In the hot plate test in mice, co-administration of 15     g/kg dexmedetomidine with 10   mg/kg ephedrine intraperitoneally not only enhanced, but also prolonged the duration of antinociception induced by dexmedetomidine. "
DDI-MedLine.d227.s8,"At the same time, the locomotor inhibitory effect of dexmedetomidine was counteracted by ephedrine. "
DDI-MedLine.d227.s9,"We concluded that the combined administration of dexmedetomidine with ephedrine may have beneficial effects in the treatment of pain without causing sedation, which limits the use of dexmedetomidine as an analgesic in humans."
DDI-MedLine.d180.s0,"Determinants of sensitivity to DZNep induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells.
"
DDI-MedLine.d180.s1,"The 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), one of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase inhibitors, has shown antitumor activities in a broad range of solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia. "
DDI-MedLine.d180.s2,"Here, we examined its effects on multiple myeloma (MM) cells and found that, at 500 nM, it potently inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in 2 of 8 MM cell lines. "
DDI-MedLine.d180.s3,RNA from un-treated and DZNep treated cells was profiled by Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray and genes with a significant change in gene expression were determined by significance analysis of microarray (SAM) testing. 
DDI-MedLine.d180.s4,ALOX5 was the most down-regulated gene (5.8-fold) in sensitive cells and was expressed at low level in resistant cells. 
DDI-MedLine.d180.s5,The results were corroborated by quantitative RT-PCR. 
DDI-MedLine.d180.s6,Western-blot analysis indicated ALOX5 was highly expressed only in sensitive cell line H929 and greatly decreased upon DZNep treatment. 
DDI-MedLine.d180.s7,Ectopic expression of ALOX5 reduced sensitivity to DZNep in H929 cells. 
DDI-MedLine.d180.s8,"Furthermore, down-regulation of ALOX5 by RNA interference could also induce apoptosis in H929. "
DDI-MedLine.d180.s9,Gene expression analysis on MM patient dataset indicated ALOX5 expression was significantly higher in MM patients compared to normal plasma cells. 
DDI-MedLine.d180.s10,"We also found that Bcl-2 was overexpressed in DZNep insensitive cells, and cotreatment with DZNep and ABT-737, a Bcl-2 family inhibitor, synergistically inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of DZNep insensitive MM cells. "
DDI-MedLine.d180.s11,"Taken together, this study shows one of mechanisms of the DZNep efficacy on MM correlates with its ability to down-regulate the ALOX5 levels. "
DDI-MedLine.d180.s12,"In addition, DZNep insensitivity might be associated with overexpression of Bcl-2, and the combination of ABT-737 and DZNep could synergistically induced apoptosis. "
DDI-MedLine.d180.s13,These results suggest that DZNep may be exploited therapeutically for a subset of MM.

DDI-MedLine.d189.s1,"We present a comprehensive in vitro approach to assessing metabolism-mediated hepatotoxicity using male Sprague-Dawley rat liver slices incubated with the well characterized hepatotoxicant, precocene I, and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. "
DDI-MedLine.d189.s2,This approach combines liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC MS) detection methods with multiple toxicity endpoints to enable identification of critical metabolic pathways for hepatotoxicity. 
DDI-MedLine.d189.s3,"The incubations were performed in the absence and presence of the non-specific CYP inhibitor, 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT) and isoform-specific inhibitors. "
DDI-MedLine.d189.s4,"The metabolite profile of precocene I in rat liver slices shares some features of the in vivo profile, but also had a major difference in that epoxide dihydrodiol hydrolysis products were not observed to a measurable extent. "
DDI-MedLine.d189.s5,"As examples of our liver slice metabolite identification procedure, a minor glutathione adduct and previously unreported 7-O-desmethyl and glucuronidated metabolites of precocene I are reported. "
DDI-MedLine.d189.s6,Precocene I induced hepatocellular necrosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. 
DDI-MedLine.d189.s7,"ABT decreased the toxicity of precocene I, increased exposure to parent compound, and decreased metabolite levels in a dose-dependent manner. "
DDI-MedLine.d189.s8,"Of the isoform-specific CYP inhibitors tested for an effect on the precocene I metabolite profile, only tranylcypromine was noticeably effective, indicating a role of CYPs 2A6, 2C9, 2Cl9, and 2E1. "
DDI-MedLine.d189.s9,"With respect to toxicity, the order of CYP inhibitor effectiveness was ABT>diethyldithiocarbamate~tranylcypromine>ketoconazole. "
DDI-MedLine.d189.s10,"Furafylline and sulfaphenazole had no effect, while quinidine appeared to augment precocene I toxicity. "
DDI-MedLine.d189.s11,These results suggest that rat liver slices do not reproduce the reported in vivo biotransformation of precocene I and therefore may not be an appropriate model for precocene I metabolism. 
DDI-MedLine.d189.s12,"However, these results provide an example of how small molecule manipulation of CYP activity in an in vitro model can be used to confirm metabolism-mediated toxicity."

DDI-MedLine.d163.s2,A total of 87 clinical isolates of MRSA collected from three Chinese hospitals were included in the study. 
DDI-MedLine.d163.s3,The checkerboard method with determination of the fractional IC index (FICI) was used to determine whether antibiotic combinations act synergistically against these isolates. 
DDI-MedLine.d163.s4,The susceptibility results for minocycline and fosfomycin were interpreted according to the most relevant criteria. 
DDI-MedLine.d163.s5,The results demonstrated the following interactions: 76 isolates (87.4%) showed synergistic interactions (FICI   0.5) and 11 isolates (12.6%) showed indifferent interactions (0.5&lt;FICI&lt;4). 
DDI-MedLine.d163.s6,No antagonistic interactions (FICI   4) were observed. 
DDI-MedLine.d163.s7,The combination of minocycline and fosfomycin can be synergistic against MRSA.

DDI-MedLine.d209.s2,"It is extensively transformed into its active metabolites by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, especially into endoxifen by isoenzyme CYP 2D6. "
DDI-MedLine.d209.s3,Co-administration of tamoxifen with isoenzyme CYP 2D6 inhibitors reduces this metabolism. 
DDI-MedLine.d209.s4,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants inhibit isoenzyme CYP 2D6. 
DDI-MedLine.d209.s5,Paroxetine and fluoxetine reduce the plasma concentration of endoxifen by about 50%. 
DDI-MedLine.d209.s6,Two epidemiological studies involving about 3700 women have shown a link between the use of SSRI antidepressants and an increased frequency of breast cancer recurrence. 
DDI-MedLine.d209.s7,"Other studies, with a lower level of evidence, were less convincing. "
DDI-MedLine.d209.s8,"Studies of other isoenzyme CYP 2D6 inhibitors showed no increase in the risk of breast cancer recurrence, but they lacked statistical power. "

DDI-MedLine.d195.s3,"By inhibiting the metabolism of drugs, piperine improves the bioavailability of drugs. "
DDI-MedLine.d195.s4,"In the present study piperine (10 mg/kg) significantly increased the dose-dependent antinociceptive activity of ibuprofen evaluated by both acetic acid writhing and formalin test, when it was administered with ibuprofen. "
DDI-MedLine.d195.s5,Ibuprofen plasma concentration was also increased when it was administered with piperine. 
DDI-MedLine.d195.s6,The synergistic antinociception activity of ibuprofen when administered with piperine can be attributed to increased plasma concentration of ibuprofen. 
DDI-MedLine.d195.s7,From this study it can be concluded that piperine can be used as a bioenhancer along with ibuprofen.

DDI-MedLine.d200.s2,All patients had indications for antihypertensive therapy and were randomized either to fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan (n=43) or to therapy which corresponded to the hospital formulary (n=43). 
DDI-MedLine.d200.s3,Correction of antihypertensive therapy was performed by treating physician at daily rounds. 
DDI-MedLine.d200.s4,Self-control of blood pressure (BP) was performed by patients with the use of UA767PC apparatus. 
DDI-MedLine.d200.s5,Results of BP self-control were compared with clinical measurements in order to detect concealed inefficacy of treatment. 
DDI-MedLine.d200.s6,Results. 
DDI-MedLine.d200.s7,Rate of achievement of target BP with fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan (93%) was comparable with that on traditional therapy (90%). 
DDI-MedLine.d200.s8,"But the use of fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan compared with traditional therapy was associated with lower clinical and self measured BP, quicker achievement of target BP (5.8+/-2.3 and 9.2+/-1.8 days, respectively, 0.05), lesser number of antihypertensive drugs (2.5+/-0.6 and 3.0+/-0.9 days, respectively), lower rate of concealed inefficacy of treatment (12 and 31%, respectively, 0.05). "
DDI-MedLine.d200.s9,Conclusions. 
DDI-MedLine.d200.s10,"We have demonstrated appropriateness of inhospital administration of fixed amlodipine/valsartan combination as an approach allowing to achieve target BP in shorter time, with the use of fewer antihypertensive drugs, and diminishing concealed inefficacy of treatment."
DDI-MedLine.d161.s0,"Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist protects dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons from degeneration in MPTP-treated monkeys.
"
DDI-MedLine.d161.s1,Degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system and of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus are important pathological features of Parkinson's disease. 
DDI-MedLine.d161.s2,There is an urgent need to develop therapies that slow down the progression of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
DDI-MedLine.d161.s3,"In the present study, we tested whether the highly specific metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist, 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine, reduces dopaminergic and noradrenergic neuronal loss in monkeys rendered parkinsonian by chronic treatment with low doses of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. "
DDI-MedLine.d161.s4,"Weekly intramuscular 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine injections (0.2-0.5 mg/kg body weight), in combination with daily administration of 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine or vehicle, were performed until the development of parkinsonian motor symptoms in either of the two experimental groups (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine versus 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle). "
DDI-MedLine.d161.s5,"After 21 weeks of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment, all 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle-treated animals displayed parkinsonian symptoms, whereas none of the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine-treated monkeys were significantly affected. "
DDI-MedLine.d161.s6,"These behavioural observations were consistent with in vivo positron emission tomography dopamine transporter imaging data, and with post-mortem stereological counts of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, as well as striatal intensity measurements of dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, which were all significantly higher in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine-treated animals than in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle-treated monkeys. "
DDI-MedLine.d161.s7,"The 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine treatment also had a significant effect on the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced loss of norepinephrine neurons in the locus coeruleus and adjoining A5 and A7 noradrenaline cell groups. "
DDI-MedLine.d161.s8,"In 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle-treated animals, almost 40% loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive norepinephrine neurons was found in locus coeruleus/A5/A7 noradrenaline cell groups, whereas the extent of neuronal loss was lower than 15% of control values in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine-treated monkeys. "
DDI-MedLine.d161.s9,"Our data demonstrate that chronic treatment with the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist, 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine, significantly reduces 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine toxicity towards dopaminergic and noradrenergic cell groups in non-human primates. "
DDI-MedLine.d161.s10,This suggests that the use of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonists may be a useful strategy to reduce degeneration of catecholaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease.

DDI-MedLine.d217.s5,We found antagonism between celecoxib and the four drugs in the breast cancer cells MCF7 following all incubation schedules and between celecoxib and doxorubicin in all cell lines except for two combinations in HCT116 cells. 
DDI-MedLine.d217.s6,Celecoxib with the other three drugs in the remaining four cell lines resulted in variable interactions. 
DDI-MedLine.d217.s7,Mechanistic investigations revealed that celecoxib exerts different molecular effects in different cells. 
DDI-MedLine.d217.s8,"In some lines, it abrogates the drug-induced G2/M arrest enhancing pre-mature entry into mitosis with damaged DNA thus increasing apoptosis and resulting in synergism. "
DDI-MedLine.d217.s9,"In other cells, it enhances drug-induced G2/M arrest allowing time to repair drug-induced DNA damage before entry into mitosis and decreasing cell death resulting in antagonism. "
DDI-MedLine.d217.s10,"In some synergistic combinations, celecoxib-induced abrogation of G2/M arrest was not associated with apoptosis but permanent arrest in G1 phase. "
DDI-MedLine.d217.s11,"These results, if confirmed in-vivo, indicate that celecoxib is not a suitable chemosensitizer for breast cancer or with doxorubicin for other cancers. "

DDI-MedLine.d201.s1,The therapeutic outcome for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remains poor; 
DDI-MedLine.d201.s2,"thus, novel, targeted therapies are urgently needed. "
DDI-MedLine.d201.s3,"Recently, we showed that heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a member of the EGF family, is a promising target for the treatment of various types of cancer. "
DDI-MedLine.d201.s4,"The aim of the present study was to investigate whether HB-EGF is a therapeutic target for T-ALL, and to further elucidate the antitumor effects of a specific inhibitor of HB-EGF, cross-reacting material 197 (CRM197). "
DDI-MedLine.d201.s5,"We elucidated the expression of HB-EGF in T-ALL cell lines, and evaluated the effect of CRM197 on these cells alone or in combination with anticancer agent. "
DDI-MedLine.d201.s6,"The expression of EGFR and EGFR ligands was determined by flow cytometry, RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR. "
DDI-MedLine.d201.s7,Induction of apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay. 
DDI-MedLine.d201.s8,"HB-EGF was strongly expressed by T-ALL cell lines, and the expression of both HB-EGF and EGFR was enhanced by doxorubicin. "
DDI-MedLine.d201.s9,"CRM197 induced apoptosis, and furthermore, the combination of CRM197 plus doxorubicin enhanced cytotoxicity in a T-ALL cell line. "
DDI-MedLine.d201.s10,These results suggest that HB-EGF is a promising therapeutic target for T-ALL.
DDI-MedLine.d154.s0,"Enhancement of humoral immune responses to inactivated Newcastle disease and avian influenza vaccines by oral administration of ginseng stem-and-leaf saponins in chickens.
"
DDI-MedLine.d154.s1,Newcastle disease (ND) and avian influenza (AI) are common in the poultry industry. 
DDI-MedLine.d154.s2,The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral administration of ginseng stem-and-leaf saponins (GSLS) on the humoral immune responses of chickens to inactivated ND and AI vaccines. 
DDI-MedLine.d154.s3,"In experiment 1, oral administration of GSLS at a dose of 5 mg/kg of BW for 7 d on the immune response in chickens intramuscularly injected with inactivated ND vaccine was evaluated. "
DDI-MedLine.d154.s4,Results showed that GSLS significantly increased the antibody level against ND in the serum of chickens. 
DDI-MedLine.d154.s5,"In experiment 2, the same regimen of GSLS was administered to chickens inoculated with inactivated AI vaccines, and an enhanced serum antibody response to AI vaccination was also observed. "
DDI-MedLine.d154.s6,"Considering the safety of GSLS, because no adverse effect was found throughout the experiments, GSLS may be a promising oral adjuvant to improve immunization in poultry."
DDI-MedLine.d194.s0,"The role of p27(Kip1) in dasatinib-enhanced paclitaxel cytotoxicity in human ovarian cancer cells.
"
DDI-MedLine.d194.s1,Less than 50% of ovarian cancers respond to paclitaxel. 
DDI-MedLine.d194.s2,Effective strategies are needed to enhance paclitaxel sensitivity.
DDI-MedLine.d194.s3,A library of silencing RNAs (siRNAs) was used to identify kinases that regulate paclitaxel sensitivity in human ovarian cancer SKOv3 cells. 
DDI-MedLine.d194.s4,"The effect of dasatinib, an inhibitor of Src and Abl kinases, on paclitaxel sensitivity was measured in ovarian cancer cells and HEY xenografts. "
DDI-MedLine.d194.s5,"The roles of p27(Kip1), Bcl-2, and Cdk1 in apoptosis induced by dasatinib and paclitaxel were assessed using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, siRNA knockdown of gene expression, transfection with Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression vectors, and flow cytometry. "
DDI-MedLine.d194.s6,All statistical tests were two-sided. 
DDI-MedLine.d194.s7,Src family and Abl kinases were identified as modulators of paclitaxel sensitivity in SKOv3 cells. 
DDI-MedLine.d194.s8,"The siRNA knockdown of Src, Fyn, or Abl1 enhanced paclitaxel-mediated growth inhibition in ovarian cancer cells compared with a control siRNA. "
DDI-MedLine.d194.s9,HEY cells treated with dasatinib plus paclitaxel formed fewer colonies than did cells treated with either agent alone. 
DDI-MedLine.d194.s10,"Treatment of HEY xenograft-bearing mice with dasatinib plus paclitaxel inhibited tumor growth more than treatment with either agent alone (average tumor volume per mouse, dasatinib + paclitaxel vs paclitaxel: 0.28 vs. 0.81 cm3, difference = 0.53 cm3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.44 to 0.62 cm3, P = .014); "
DDI-MedLine.d194.s11,dasatinib + paclitaxel vs. 
DDI-MedLine.d194.s12,dasatinib: 0.28 vs. 
DDI-MedLine.d194.s13,"0.55 cm3, difference = 0.27 cm3, 95% CI = 0.21 to 0.33 cm3, P = .035). "
DDI-MedLine.d194.s14,Combined treatment induced more TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells than did either agent alone. 
DDI-MedLine.d194.s15,"The siRNA knockdown of p27(Kip1) decreased dasatinib- and paclitaxel-induced apoptosis compared with a negative control siRNA (sub-G1 fraction, control siRNA vs. p27(Kip1) siRNA: 42.5% vs. 20.1%, difference = 22.4%, 95% CI = 20.1% to 24.7%, P = .017). "
DDI-MedLine.d194.s16,Studies with forced expression and siRNA knockdown of Bcl-2 and Cdk1 suggest that dasatinib-mediated induction of p27(Kip1) enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by negatively regulating Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression. 
DDI-MedLine.d194.s17,Inhibition of Src family and Abl kinases with either siRNAs or dasatinib enhances paclitaxel sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells through p27(Kip1)-mediated suppression of Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression.
DDI-MedLine.d143.s0,"[Interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors].
"
DDI-MedLine.d143.s1,The drug interaction between proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel has been the subject of much study in recent years. 
DDI-MedLine.d143.s2,Contradictory results regarding the effect of proton pump inhibitors on platelet reactivity and on clinical outcome in clopidogrel-treated patients have been reported in literature. 
DDI-MedLine.d143.s3,"Concomitant use of omeprazole and clopidogrel was found to decrease the exposure (AUC) to clopidogrel's active metabolite by 50% and to sharply increase platelet reactivity, as a result of inhibition by omeprazole of CYP2C19, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme. "
DDI-MedLine.d143.s4,Pantoprazole has a much weaker effect on clopidogrel's pharmacokinetics and on platelet reactivity during concomitant use. 
DDI-MedLine.d143.s5,The influence of the other proton pump inhibitors when used simultaneously with clopidogrel has not yet been investigated in adequately randomized studies. 
DDI-MedLine.d143.s6,Regulatory agencies state that the combination of clopidogrel and the CYP2C19 inhibitors omeprazole and esomeprazole should be avoided. 
DDI-MedLine.d143.s7,"To date, there is no conclusive evidence of a clinically-relevant interaction between any of the proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel."
DDI-MedLine.d169.s0,Calcium does not inhibit the absorption of 5 milligrams of nonheme or heme iron at doses less than 800 milligrams in nonpregnant women.
DDI-MedLine.d169.s1,Calcium is the only known component in the diet that may affect absorption of both nonheme and heme iron. 
DDI-MedLine.d169.s2,"However, the evidence for a calcium effect on iron absorption mainly comes from studies that did not isolate the effect of calcium from that of other dietary components, because it was detected in single-meal studies. "
DDI-MedLine.d169.s3,Our objective was to establish potential effects of calcium on absorption of nonheme and heme iron and the dose response for this effect in the absence of a meal. 
DDI-MedLine.d169.s4,"Fifty-four healthy, nonpregnant women were selected to participate in 4 iron absorption studies using iron radioactive tracers. "
DDI-MedLine.d169.s5,We evaluated the effects of calcium doses between 200 and 1500 mg on absorption of 5 mg nonheme iron (as ferrous sulfate). 
DDI-MedLine.d169.s6,We also evaluated the effects of calcium doses between 200 and 800 mg on absorption of 5 mg heme iron [as concentrated RBC (CRBC)]. 
DDI-MedLine.d169.s7,Calcium was administered as calcium chloride in all studies and minerals were ingested on an empty stomach. 
DDI-MedLine.d169.s8,Calcium doses   1000 mg diminished nonheme iron absorption by an average of 49.6%.
DDI-MedLine.d169.s9,A calcium dose of 800 mg diminished absorption of 5 mg heme iron by 37.7%. 
DDI-MedLine.d169.s10,"In conclusion, we demonstrated an isolated effect of calcium (as chloride) on absorption of 5 mg of iron provided as nonheme (as sulfate) and heme (as CRBC) iron. "
DDI-MedLine.d169.s11,"This effect was observed at doses higher than previously reported from single-meal studies, starting at ~800 mg of calcium."
DDI-MedLine.d164.s0,"Lapatinib enhances herceptin-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by up-regulation of cell surface HER2 expression.
"
DDI-MedLine.d164.s1,"Although it was previously reported that lapatinib combined with Herceptin improved the progression-free survival rate compared with lapatinib alone for patients with Herceptin-refractory HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, the mechanism is purported to be an antiproliferative effect relating to the synergism of these two agents."
DDI-MedLine.d164.s2,"We evaluated how lapatinib interacts with Herceptin in HER2-positive breast cancer, with a particular focus on Herceptin-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). "
DDI-MedLine.d164.s3,"In an in vitro assay, lapatinib induced HER2 expression at the cell surface of HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines, leading to the enhancement of Herceptin-mediated ADCC. "
DDI-MedLine.d164.s4,"Furthermore, we present a case report in which a second Herceptin treatment following lapatinib resulted in the marked shrinkage of multiple metastatic tumors in HER2-positive breast cancer. "
DDI-MedLine.d164.s5,Lapatinib may have the potential to convert Herceptin-refractory to Herceptin-sensitive tumors in HER2-positive breast cancer by up-regulation of the cell surface expression of HER2.
DDI-MedLine.d179.s0,Synergistic interaction between sunitinib and docetaxel is sequence dependent in human non-small lung cancer with EGFR TKIs-resistant mutation.
DDI-MedLine.d179.s1,Previous studies have demonstrated that sunitinib has the anti-tumor activity in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
DDI-MedLine.d179.s2,This study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of single use of sunitinib and that of concurrent or sequential administration of sunitinib and docetaxel in NSCLC cell lines that are resistant to EGFR TKIs.
DDI-MedLine.d179.s3,NSCLC cell lines with EGFR T790M mutation and K-ras mutation were exposed to either sunitinib or docetaxel or both based on various sequential administrations. 
DDI-MedLine.d179.s4,"After exposure, the cell viability was measured by MTT assay, cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry, and alterations in signaling pathway were determined by immunoblotting. "
DDI-MedLine.d179.s5,"Sunitinib exhibited dose-dependent growth inhibition in NSCLC cell lines and arrested cell cycle at G1 phase, whereas docetaxel arrested at S phase. "
DDI-MedLine.d179.s6,"Although single or concurrent use of sunitinib and docetaxel has some anti-proliferative effects, the sequential administrations of both drugs remarkably enhanced anti-tumor activity. "
DDI-MedLine.d179.s7,"When cells were exposed to docetaxel followed by sunitinib, synergism was observed. "
DDI-MedLine.d179.s8,The molecular basis of this synergism is that the signaling pathways that were initially activated by docetaxel exposure were efficiently suppressed by the subsequent exposure to sunitinib. 
DDI-MedLine.d179.s9,"In contrast, the reverse of this sequential administration resulted in antagonism, which may be due to differential effects on cell cycle arrest. "
DDI-MedLine.d179.s10,Sunitinib as a single agent exhibits anti-proliferative effects in vitro in NSCLC cell lines with EGFR T790M and K-ras mutations but the sequential administration of docetaxel followed by sunitinib is superior to sunitinib followed by docetaxel and concurrent administration.
DDI-MedLine.d193.s0,Ticagrelor (Brilinta)--better than clopidogrel (Plavix)
DDI-MedLine.d193.s1,"The FDA has approved ticagrelor (Brilinta-AstraZeneca), an oral antiplatelet drug, for use with low-dose aspirin to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). "
DDI-MedLine.d193.s2,It will compete with clopidogrel (Plavix) and prasugrel (Effient) for such use. 
DDI-MedLine.d193.s3,Clopidogrel is expected to become available generically in the US within the next few months.
DDI-MedLine.d190.s0,"Glycosidic enzymes enhance retinal transduction following intravitreal delivery of AAV2.
"
DDI-MedLine.d190.s1,To determine whether the co-injection of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes improves retinal transduction following intravitreal delivery of adeno-associated virus-2 (AAV2).
DDI-MedLine.d190.s2,"AAV2 containing cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP), under the control of a chicken   -actin promoter, was delivered by intravitreal injection to adult mice in conjunction with enzymes including collagenase, hyaluronan lyase, heparinase III, or chondroitin ABC lyase. "
DDI-MedLine.d190.s3,"Two weeks later, retinal flatmounts were examined for GFP expression using confocal microscopy. "
DDI-MedLine.d190.s4,"Without the addition of enzymes, transduction was limited to occasional cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer. "
DDI-MedLine.d190.s5,The addition of heparinase III or chondroitin ABC lyase greatly enhanced transduction of the retinal ganglion cell layer and increased the depth of transduction into the outer retina. 
DDI-MedLine.d190.s6,Hyaluronan lyase had a limited effect and collagenase was ineffective. 
DDI-MedLine.d190.s7,Electroretinograms survived with higher concentrations of heparinase III and chondroitin ABC lyase than were required for optimal retinal transduction. 
DDI-MedLine.d190.s8,AAV2-mediated retinal transduction is improved by co-injection of heparinase III or chondroitin ABC lyase. 
DDI-MedLine.d190.s9,Improved transduction efficiency may allow intravitreal injection to become the preferred route for delivering gene therapy to both the inner and outer retina.
DDI-MedLine.d181.s0,"Drug interaction of levothyroxine with infant colic drops.
"
DDI-MedLine.d181.s1,"Infacol (Forest Laboratories UK, Kent, UK) is a widely available over-the-counter preparation used to relieve colic symptoms in neonates and infants. "
DDI-MedLine.d181.s2,The active ingredient is simeticone. 
DDI-MedLine.d181.s3,No drug interactions with simeticone are documented in the current summary of product characteristics. 
DDI-MedLine.d181.s4,The authors report the case of an infant with confirmed congenital hypothyroidism on levothyroxine who experienced a possible drug interaction with simeticone. 
DDI-MedLine.d181.s5,"Despite adequate levothyroxine dosage, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was high, suggesting undertreatment. "
DDI-MedLine.d181.s6,Questioning revealed the child was taking Infacol drops before feeds while on levothyroxine. 
DDI-MedLine.d181.s7,The colic drops were immediately discontinued and TSH promptly normalised with a reduction in thyroxine requirement to an age appropriate dosage. 
DDI-MedLine.d181.s8,Drug interaction of thyroxine with simeticone has not been reported previously and is not listed in the British National Formulary for Children. 
DDI-MedLine.d181.s9,Clinicians and parents need to be aware of this interaction to avoid unnecessary undertreatment and prevent potential long-term neurological sequelae.
DDI-MedLine.d213.s0,"In vivo CYP3A activity is significantly lower in cyclosporine-treated as compared with tacrolimus-treated renal allograft recipients.
"
DDI-MedLine.d213.s1,In vitro studies have identified cyclosporine and tacrolimus as CYP3A inhibitors. 
DDI-MedLine.d213.s2,"In the current study in renal allograft recipients, we used intravenously and orally administered midazolam as a drug probe to assess whether the study drugs at doses that are generally used in clinical practice have differential effects on in vivo hepatic and first-pass CYP3A activities. "
DDI-MedLine.d213.s3,"Systemic and apparent oral midazolam clearance were 24% (269    73 vs. 354    102  ml/min, P = 0.022) and 31% (479    190 vs. 688    265  ml/min, P = 0.013), respectively, lower in cyclosporine-treated patients (n = 20) than in matched tacrolimus-treated patients (n = 20). "
DDI-MedLine.d213.s4,The latter displayed midazolam clearances similar to those in two larger cohorts of nonmatched tacrolimus-treated patients (n = 58 and n = 80) and to those receiving a calcineurin inhibitor-free regimen (n = 6). 
DDI-MedLine.d213.s5,"This implies that in vivo hepatic and first-pass CYP3A activities are significantly lower in patients receiving cyclosporine than in those receiving tacrolimus, indicating that, at the doses generally used in clinical practice, cyclosporine is the stronger of the two with respect to CYP3A inhibition. "
DDI-MedLine.d213.s6,This observation has important implications in the context of drug-drug interactions in transplant recipients.

DDI-MedLine.d214.s3,were studied in elevated plus maze test on C57BL/6 mice. 
DDI-MedLine.d214.s4,"On second day after injection, MPTP decreased the locomot or activity in comparison to saline. "
DDI-MedLine.d214.s5,"Acute administration of hemantane or doxycycline failed to influence locomotion in mice, while their combination normalized motor activity. "
DDI-MedLine.d214.s6,The results obtained confirm the role of inflammatory processes in parkinsonism and suggest expediency of combined pharmacotherapy of neurodegenerative diseases.
DDI-MedLine.d147.s0,"Interaction of dacarbazine and imexon, in vitro and in vivo, in human A375 melanoma cells.
"
DDI-MedLine.d147.s1,"We evaluated mechanisms of interaction between the alkyating agent dacarbazine (DTIC) and the pro-oxidant, imexon, in the human A375 melanoma cell line."
DDI-MedLine.d147.s2,"The effect of DTIC and imexon, alone and in combination, was evaluated for growth inhibition (MTT), radiolabeled drug uptake, cellular thiol content (HPLC), and DNA strand breaks (Comet assay). "
DDI-MedLine.d147.s3,Pharmacokinetic and antitumor effects were evaluated in mice. 
DDI-MedLine.d147.s4,Growth inhibition in vitro was additive with the two drugs. 
DDI-MedLine.d147.s5,There was no effect on drug uptake or on the number of DNA strand breaks. 
DDI-MedLine.d147.s6,There was a >75% reduction in cellular glutathione and cysteine with imexon but not DTIC. 
DDI-MedLine.d147.s7,"Co-administration of the two drugs in mice caused an increase in the area under the curve of both drugs, but the combination was not effective in reducing human A375 melanoma tumors in vivo. "
DDI-MedLine.d147.s8,Imexon and dacarbazine show additive effects in vitro but not in vivo in human A375 melanoma cells.
DDI-MedLine.d199.s0,"Prevention of emergence agitation in seven children receiving low-dose ketamine and propofol total intravenous anesthesia.
"
DDI-MedLine.d199.s1,Emergence agitation (EA) can be a distressing side effect of pediatric anesthesia. 
DDI-MedLine.d199.s2,We retrospectively reviewed the records of 7 pediatric oncology patients who received low-dose ketamine in conjunction with propofol for total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) repeatedly for radiation therapy. 
DDI-MedLine.d199.s3,EA signs were observed in all 7 patients in association with propofol TIVA but did not recur in any of 123 subsequent anesthetics sessions during which low-dose ketamine was added to propofol. 
DDI-MedLine.d199.s4,"Based on this experience, we suggest that low-dose ketamine added to propofol may be associated with prevention of EA in children with a history of EA with propofol TIVA."
DDI-MedLine.d184.s0,"Amphetamine locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference in adolescent male and female rats neonatally treated with quinpirole.
"
DDI-MedLine.d184.s1,Neonatal quinpirole treatment has been shown to produce an increase in dopamine D2-like receptor sensitivity that persists throughout the subject's lifetime. 
DDI-MedLine.d184.s2,The objective was to analyze the effects of neonatal quinpirole treatment on effects of amphetamine in adolescent rats using locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference procedures. 
DDI-MedLine.d184.s3,Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with quinpirole (1 mg/kg) or saline from postnatal days (P)1 to P11 and raised to adolescence. 
DDI-MedLine.d184.s4,"For locomotor sensitization, subjects were given amphetamine (1 mg/kg) or saline every second day from P35 to P47 and were placed into a locomotor arena. "
DDI-MedLine.d184.s5,"In female rats, neonatal quinpirole treatment enhanced amphetamine locomotor sensitization compared with quinpirole-free controls sensitized to amphetamine. "
DDI-MedLine.d184.s6,"Male rats demonstrated sensitization to amphetamine, although this was muted compared with female rats, and were unaffected by neonatal quinpirole. "
DDI-MedLine.d184.s7,"For conditioned place preference, subjects were conditioned for 8 consecutive days (P32-39) with amphetamine (1 mg/kg) or saline and a drug-free preference test was conducted at P40. "
DDI-MedLine.d184.s8,"Rats treated with neonatal quinpirole enhanced time spent in the amphetamine-paired context compared with quinpirole-free controls conditioned with amphetamine, but only female controls conditioned with amphetamine spent more time in the drug-paired context compared with saline-treated controls. "
DDI-MedLine.d184.s9,"Increased D   -like receptor sensitivity appears to have enhanced the behavioral effects of amphetamine, but these effects were more prevalent in adolescent female rats compared with male rats."
