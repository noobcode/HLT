DDI-MedLine.d192.s0,Identification of a dopamine receptor-mediated opiate reward memory switch in the basolateral amygdala-nucleus accumbens circuit.
DDI-MedLine.d192.s1,"The basolateral amygdala (BLA), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and nucleus accumbens (NAc) play central roles in the processing of opiate-related associative reward learning and memory. "
DDI-MedLine.d192.s2,"The BLA receives innervation from dopaminergic fibers originating in the VTA, and both dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors are expressed in this region. "
DDI-MedLine.d192.s3,"Using a combination of in vivo single-unit extracellular recording in the NAc combined with behavioral pharmacology studies, we have identified a double dissociation in the functional roles of DA D1 versus D2 receptor transmission in the BLA, which depends on opiate exposure state; "
DDI-MedLine.d192.s4,"thus, in previously opiate-naive rats, blockade of intra-BLA D1, but not D2, receptor transmission blocked the acquisition of associative opiate reward memory, measured in an unbiased conditioned place preference procedure. "
DDI-MedLine.d192.s5,"In direct contrast, in rats made opiate dependent and conditioned in a state of withdrawal, intra-BLA D2, but not D1, receptor blockade blocked opiate reward encoding. "
DDI-MedLine.d192.s6,This functional switch was dependent on cAMP signaling as comodulation of intra-BLA cAMP levels reversed or replicated the functional effects of intra-BLA D1 or D2 transmission during opiate reward processing. 
DDI-MedLine.d192.s7,Single-unit in vivo extracellular recordings performed in neurons of the NAc confirmed an opiate-state-dependent role for BLA D1/D2 transmission in NAc neuronal response patterns to morphine.

DDI-MedLine.d170.s2,The functional alterations in the epileptiform hippocampus critically depend on GABAergic mechanisms and cation-chloride cotransporters.
DDI-MedLine.d170.s3,"To understand the cellular basis of specific functional alterations in the epileptic hippocampus, we studied physiologic characteristics and pharmacologically isolated evoked GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) recorded from principal neurons in hippocampal slices from status epilepticus (SE) and control rats using whole-cell and gramicidin perforated patch-clamp recordings. "
DDI-MedLine.d170.s4,"Whereas the resting membrane potential and input resistance were not significantly different between control and epileptic tissue, the reversal potential (E(GABA) ) of IPSCs was significantly shifted to more positive values in SE rats with regard to the resting membrane potential. "
DDI-MedLine.d170.s5,"Pharmacologic experiments and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that the observed changes in the epileptic tissue were due to a decreased ratio of the main Cl(-) extrusion transporter (K(+) -Cl(-) cotransporter, KCC2) to the main Cl(-) uptake transporter (Na(+) -K(+) -2Cl(-) cotransporter, NKCC1). "
DDI-MedLine.d170.s6,"Our results suggest that alterations of cation-chloride cotransporter functions, comprising a higher NKCC1 action, contribute to hyperexcitability within the hippocampus following SE."

"
DDI-MedLine.d183.s1,Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that appears essentially as a sporadic condition. 
DDI-MedLine.d183.s2,PD is well known to be a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease produced by a selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. 
DDI-MedLine.d183.s3,"The main clinical features of PD include tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability. "
DDI-MedLine.d183.s4,"Most insights into pathogenesis of PD come from investigations performed in experimental models of PD, especially those produced by neurotoxins. "
DDI-MedLine.d183.s5,"The biochemical and cellular alterations that occur after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment are remarkably similar to that observed in idiopathic PD. "
DDI-MedLine.d183.s6,"Furthermore, it is well known that acute treatment with MPTP can cause a severe loss of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter protein levels and dopamine contents in the striatum of mice, as compared to continuous MPTP treatment. "
DDI-MedLine.d183.s7,Thus these findings may support the validity of acute MPTP treatment model for unraveling in the neurodegenerative processes in PD. 
DDI-MedLine.d183.s8,"In this review, we discuss the neuroprotective effects of various compounds against neuronal cell loss in an MPTP model of PD. "

DDI-MedLine.d150.s2,These adverse side effects have been used to infer whether two drugs share a target protein. 
DDI-MedLine.d150.s3,"However, side-effect similarity of drugs could also be caused by their target proteins being close in a molecular network, which as such could cause similar downstream effects. "
DDI-MedLine.d150.s4,"In this study, we investigated the proportion of side-effect similarities that is due to targets that are close in the network compared to shared drug targets. "
DDI-MedLine.d150.s5,"We found that only a minor fraction of side-effect similarities (5.8 %) are caused by drugs targeting proteins close in the network, compared to side-effect similarities caused by overlapping drug targets (64%). "
DDI-MedLine.d150.s6,"Moreover, these targets that cause similar side effects are more often in a linear part of the network, having two or less interactions, than drug targets in general. "
DDI-MedLine.d150.s7,"Based on the examples, we gained novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of side effects associated with several drug targets. "

DDI-MedLine.d176.s0,"Nitric oxide is an activity-dependent regulator of target neuron intrinsic excitability.
"
DDI-MedLine.d176.s1,"Activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength are well established as mediating long-term plasticity underlying learning and memory, but modulation of  target neuron excitability could complement changes in synaptic strength and regulate network activity. "
DDI-MedLine.d176.s2,"It is thought that homeostatic mechanisms match intrinsic excitability to the incoming synaptic drive, but evidence for involvement of voltage-gated conductances is sparse. "
DDI-MedLine.d176.s3,"Here, we show that glutamatergic synaptic activity modulates target neuron excitability and switches the basis of action potential repolarization from Kv3 to Kv2 potassium channel dominance, thereby adjusting neuronal signaling between low and high activity states, respectively. "
DDI-MedLine.d176.s4,This nitric oxide-mediated signaling dramatically increases Kv2 currents in both the auditory brain stem and hippocampus (&gt;3-fold) transforming synaptic integration and information transmission but with only modest changes in action potential waveform. 
DDI-MedLine.d176.s5,"We conclude that nitric oxide is a homeostatic regulator, tuning neuronal excitability to the recent history of excitatory synaptic inputs over intervals of minutes to hours."

DDI-MedLine.d206.s2,"In the present study, the antidepressant like activity of curcumin and its combination with fluoxetine and imipramine was studied in acute model (three doses 24, 5 and 1 h before test) of forced swimming test (FST) in glass jar and tail suspension test (TST) in mice and in chronic model (14 day study) of FST with water wheel in rats. "
DDI-MedLine.d206.s3,"All the tests were carried out in the following seven groups (n = 6 in each group), drugs being given orally (doses for mice): Group 1 (vehicle), group 2 (curcumin 50 mg/kg), group 3 (curcumin 100 mg/kg), group 4 (fluoxetine 20 mg/kg), group 5 (imipramine 15 mg/kg), group 6 (curcumin 100 mg/kg plus fluoxetine 20 mg/kg) and group 7 (curcumin 100 mg/kg plus imipramine 15 mg/kg). "
DDI-MedLine.d206.s4,Equivalent doses for rats were used. 
DDI-MedLine.d206.s5,"Both the acute model of FST and TST, and the chronic model of FST with water wheel showed significant antidepressant like activity of curcumin in 100 mg/kg dose as compared to vehicle control (p < 0.05). "
DDI-MedLine.d206.s6,The effect of curcumin (100 mg/kg) was similar to that of fluoxetine and imipramine (p > 0.05) but its addition to fluoxetine and imipramine did not improve their antidepressant activity (p > 0.05). 
DDI-MedLine.d206.s7,"Curcumin increased both the swimming and climbing behavior in FST, thus its antidepressant like activity could be due to an increase in serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the brain. "
DDI-MedLine.d206.s8,Curcumin can be a useful antidepressant especially in cases which respond to drugs having mixed effects on serotonin and catecholamines levels in the brain.

DDI-MedLine.d152.s0,"Mechanisms of drug toxicity or intolerance.
"
DDI-MedLine.d152.s1,"Classically, adverse drug reactions had been considered as type A reactions which are related to the main pharmacological action of the drug and therefore are predictable. "
DDI-MedLine.d152.s2,"Such reactions are predictable, reversible, and usually can be managed by lowering the dose of the offending drug. "
DDI-MedLine.d152.s3,"However, other adverse effects of drugs can occur which are unrelated to the main pharmacological action of the drug - type B reactions. "
DDI-MedLine.d152.s4,Such adverse effects are termed idiosyncratic and are often initiated by metabolites of the parent drug or by other indirect mechanisms. 
DDI-MedLine.d152.s5,The detailed understanding of adverse drug events has become a major focus of the regulatory agencies throughout the world. 
DDI-MedLine.d152.s6,The pharmacotherapy of gastrointestinal and liver disorders is becoming increasingly complex. 
DDI-MedLine.d152.s7,"In recent years, with the advent of novel therapeutic agents to treat a host of disorders, including viral hepatitis, gastrointestinal motility disorders, inflammatory bowel disease and others, the potential for serious clinically relevant drug reactions has increased. "
DDI-MedLine.d152.s8,"In the pharmacotherapy of gastrointestinal and liver diseases, a significant number of adverse events that occur can be explained by drug interactions. "
DDI-MedLine.d152.s9,"Some pharmacokinetic drug interactions are based on the competitive inhibition of the rate of drug metabolism of one of the drugs, leading to an increased concentration of the drug which was not intended. "
DDI-MedLine.d152.s10,"In other examples, the interaction can be mechanistic in which one or more drugs when co-administered potentiate each other's actions without any change in drug levels, termed pharmacodynamic interactions."
DDI-MedLine.d202.s0,Flow cytometry-based pharmacodynamic monitoring after organ transplantation.
DDI-MedLine.d202.s1,Conventional therapeutic drug monitoring based on measuring immunosupressive drug concentrations in blood is important in the clinical management of immunosuppressive therapy in transplantation medicine. 
DDI-MedLine.d202.s2,Since rejection or infection occurs at irregular drug concentrations immunosuppressive drug therapy is often empiric and prophylactic in nature. 
DDI-MedLine.d202.s3,"In addition, blood immunosuppressant levels are only indirect predictors of the pharmacologic effects on immune cells, because the genetic heterogeneity the immune systems of transplant recipients are not equally sensitive to drug effects. "
DDI-MedLine.d202.s4,"Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring requires the application of reliable and effective methods to study the pharmacodynamic variability by direct measurements of drug effects on immune cell functions. "
DDI-MedLine.d202.s5,"Flow cytometry offers a multiplicity of quantitative analysis possibilities, from detection of phosphorylated molecules up to complex multicolor analysis of whole blood samples. "
DDI-MedLine.d202.s6,A large spectrum of flow cytometry-based applications for pharmacodynamic monitoring is available and allows detection and analysis of diverse function of T cells and dendritic cell subsets. 
DDI-MedLine.d202.s7,"By combining several assays, it is possible to generate a broad picture of the immune status of every single transplanted recipient. "
DDI-MedLine.d202.s8,"Furthermore, it is even possible to differentiate between synergistic and antagonistic pharmacodynamic effects of immunosuppressive drug combination therapy in vitro and to predict the pharmacodynamic drug effects in transplanted recipients. "
DDI-MedLine.d202.s9,"Such a pharmacodynamic drug monitoring may offer the opportunity to complete conventional therapeutic drug monitoring and, therefore, to tailor immunosuppressive therapy more individually."

DDI-MedLine.d197.s3,"As such interactions impact the health of the patient and the action and side effects of the drug, physicians and pharmacists should pay more attention to such interactions in the future. "
DDI-MedLine.d197.s4,A number of drugs can interfere with the vitamin D and bone metabolism. 
DDI-MedLine.d197.s5,"The drug-induced activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR) is likely to enhance CYP24 expression and the catabolism of 25(OH)D, leading to vitamin D deficiency. "
DDI-MedLine.d197.s6,"PXR-ligands include a wide variety of pharmaceutical agents, such as antiepileptic drugs, taxol, rifampicin, and human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors such as ritonavir and saquinavir. "

DDI-MedLine.d232.s2,"However, stroke risk is not homogeneous and varies with associated morbidities and risk factors. "
DDI-MedLine.d232.s3,Risk stratification schemes have been developed that categorize patients' stroke risk into classes based on a combination of risk factors. 
DDI-MedLine.d232.s4,"According to the calculated level of risk, guidelines recommend patients with atrial fibrillation receive antithrombotic therapy either as a vitamin K antagonist or aspirin. "
DDI-MedLine.d232.s5,"Despite recommendations, however, many patients with atrial fibrillation do not receive adequate thromboprophylaxis. "
DDI-MedLine.d232.s6,"We will discuss some of the underlying reasons, in part related to the drawbacks associated with vitamin K antagonists. "
DDI-MedLine.d232.s7,These highlight the need for new anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation. 
DDI-MedLine.d232.s8,The novel oral anticoagulants in development may overcome some of the limitations of vitamin K antagonists and address their underuse and safety concerns.
DDI-MedLine.d155.s0,"The role of interneurons in shaping Purkinje cell responses in the cerebellar cortex.
"
DDI-MedLine.d155.s1,The well established anatomy of the cerebellar cortex has led to suggestions that cerebellar molecular layer interneurons laterally inhibit Purkinje cells. 
DDI-MedLine.d155.s2,"In support of the anatomical predictions, on-beam excitation and off-beam inhibition of Purkinje cells have been shown to occur when the surface of the cerebellum is electrically excited. "
DDI-MedLine.d155.s3,Patchy excitation of Purkinje cells with flanking inhibition of sagittally oriented Purkinje cells have also been demonstrated following peripheral stimulation in vivo. 
DDI-MedLine.d155.s4,"To extend these observations, we mapped the functional connectivity between granule cells, molecular layer interneurons, and Purkinje cells in rats. "
DDI-MedLine.d155.s5,Patches of granule cells were asynchronously activated by photostimulation to mimic their excitation by a mossy fiber as it occurs in vivo. 
DDI-MedLine.d155.s6,"We found with remarkable consistency that, in the sagittal orientation, granule cells elicit a stereotypic set of responses. "
DDI-MedLine.d155.s7,Granule cells immediately underneath a Purkinje cell provide pure excitation. 
DDI-MedLine.d155.s8,"Granule cells positioned 340-400   m laterally provided pure inhibition, consistent with the lateral inhibition proposed earlier. "
DDI-MedLine.d155.s9,"The net effect of exciting granule cells in between these two extremes was to provide a systematic change in the response of Purkinje cells, from net excitation to net inhibition moving laterally from the Purkinje cell. "
DDI-MedLine.d155.s10,"In contrast to the sagittal orientation, in the coronal orientation the organization of Purkinje cell responses with granule cell activation was remarkably different. "
DDI-MedLine.d155.s11,"Independent of the location of granule cells, within the 480   m lateral distance examined, molecular layer interneurons reduced the strength of granule cell inputs to Purkinje cells to a comparable extent."
